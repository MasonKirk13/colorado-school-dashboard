## LEGAL EVIDENCE IMPACT

### **Before Integration:**
- Sample data with placeholder values
- Generic debt figures not tied to specific projects
- Limited historical context
- No direct connection to DPS financial statements

### **After Integration:**
- **Documentary evidence** from DPS's own audited financial reports
- **Specific project purposes** tied to individual COP series
- **10-year historical timeline** showing systematic debt accumulation
- **Direct correlation** between COP debt growth and educational outcome decline

## REMAINING DATA GAPS

### ðŸŸ¡ PARTIALLY COMPLETE (6 of 14 COP Series)

- ES1453108, ES969845, MD292921, MD403212, MD521658, MS620899

**Recommended Action:** These represent less critical series as the major debt components (8 of 14 series representing the bulk of outstanding debt) have been fully documented.
