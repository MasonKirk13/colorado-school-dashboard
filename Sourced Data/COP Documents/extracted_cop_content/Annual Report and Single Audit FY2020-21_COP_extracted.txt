MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado (the
District), provides readers of the District’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report this narrative overview
and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. We
encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information
that is presented in the letter of transmittal, which starts on page 10 of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the statement of net position, as of June 30, 2021, the District’s net position for governmental
activities is a deficit of $1,007.4 million. The deficit net position can be partially attributed to the
implementation of GASB 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions - an amendment of GASB
Statement No. 27 and GASB 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other
Than Pensions requiring the recognition of a long-term liability for pension and postemployment benefits
other than pensions respectively. The deficit net position can also be attributed to liabilities related to the
District's Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds that are to fund retirement and
necessary capital and maintenance projects of the District's facilities. In July of 1997, the District
executed $384.2 million in COPs with the net proceeds contributed to DPSRS. In April of 2008, the District
issued $750 million in COPs to refund existing certificates and to fund an additional $397.8 million
contribution to DPSRS in anticipation of the merger with PERA. As a result of these contributions, the
District’s PERA division is 90.48% funded compared to the PERA School division of 66.99% as of
December 31, 2020. Second, in order to fund the District's capital program, the voters of Denver
authorized general obligation bonds. The proceeds of these bonds are used to fund capital and
maintenance of the District's facilities. (See additional details in Note 5 and Note 6 to the financial
statements).
Long-term liabilities increased to $3,656.7 million from $3,354.9 million in FY 2021 primarily due to
issuance of Bonds.
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $1,270.8 million or 78% of total revenues
and program revenues were $336.9 million or 22% of the total revenues of the primary government. The
total revenues increased to $1,607.6 million from $1,550.6 million, or 3.5% when compared to prior year,
primarily due to increased property taxes. The change in net position of $122.1 million is partially due to
an increase in property tax revenue of $40.5 million and other revenue increase of $6.7 million. Of
notable mention, HB 20-1379 suspended the $225 million yearly direct distribution proportioned between
State, School, Judicial and DPS Division Trust Funds and is to resume as of July 1, 2021 or fiscal year
2022.
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide
financial statements, 2) fund financial statements and 3) notes to the basic financial statements. This
report also contains required supplementary information and other supplementary information.
Government-wide Statements
The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with information about the
District as a whole using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector businesses.
The statement of net position includes District assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and
deferred inflows of resources, with differences reported as net position to the exclusion of fiduciary funds.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
The statement of activities presents information on how the District’s net position changed during the
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported when the underlying event giving rise to the change
occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in
this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected
taxes and retiree sick leave payable).
The government-wide financial statements consolidate the governmental and internal service activities
that are supported from taxes and intergovernmental revenues. In the government-wide financial
statements the District’s activities are shown as:
Governmental activities: Most of the District’s basic services are included here, such as instruction,
transportation, operations and maintenance and administration. Taxes and intergovernmental revenues
principally support these activities.
The government-wide financial statements encompass not only the District itself (the primary
government) but also legally-separate entities including the ProComp Special Revenue Fund, Denver
School Facilities Leasing Corporation, Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust and Private
Purpose Trust as blended component units and Denver Public Schools Foundation and charter schools as
discretely presented component units.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts used to maintain control over resources that have been
segregated for specific activities or objectives. The fund financial statements provide more detailed
information about the District’s operations, focusing on its most significant or major funds, not the District
as a whole. The District has three types of funds: governmental funds, proprietary funds and fiduciary
funds.
Governmental funds: Most of the District’s services are included in governmental funds, which
generally focus on how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flows and
the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds
statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine the status of financial resources that
can be spent in the near future to finance the District’s programs.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. Thus,
readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.
Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to the government-wide financial
statements in order to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental
activities. The District maintains nine individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately
in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances for the General, Grants Special Revenue, Bond Redemption
(debt service), Building and Capital Reserve, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data for the
other five governmental funds (Pupil Activity Special Revenue, Food Services Special Revenue, ProComp
Special Revenue, Mill Levy Technology Maintenance and Permanent) are combined into a single,
aggregated presentation. Individual fund data for each of these nonmajor governmental funds is provided
in the form of combining statements included in this report.

 The 2020 voter approved general bond obligations were issued in 2021 with the following ratings:
 Moody’s ratings of Aa1
 Fitch ratings of AA+
 S&P ratings of AA+
A significant portion of the District’s assets are its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings,
equipment and capital leases). The District uses these assets to provide instruction and related services to
its students. Capital assets (net) increased to $1,612.2 million in FY 2021 from $1,554.3 million in FY
2020. The increase is primarily a result of capital spending from the District’s general obligation bonds
and certificates of participation. The District’s capital assets will continue to increase as planned projects
are completed in the Capital Reserve and Building Funds. Combined, these funds have available fund
balance of $575.7 million.
Current and other assets increased to $1,212.5 million from $900.4 million primarily due to the first
issuance of the 2021 general obligation bonds.
The following table provides a summary of the District’s net position as of June 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively (in millions):
June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020
Current and other assets $ 1,212.5 $ 900.4

Long-term liabilities 3,656.7 3,354.9
Total liabilities 3,816.1 3,548.5
Deferred inflows of resources 510.5 306.2
Net position (deficit):

Unrestricted (1,234.5) (1,322.5)
Total net position (deficit) $ (1,007.4) $ (1,129.5)
To calculate net investment in capital assets, the original long-term debt was evaluated to ascertain the
amount of proceeds spent on capital improvement versus non-capital expenditures. The percentage was
then applied to the outstanding long-term debt to determine the amount applicable to capital assets.

Most revenues to Colorado's school districts are provided through the Public School Finance Act of 1994
(as amended). The District’s adjusted total program funding for FY 2021 was $749.6 million reflected as a
combination of state equalization and a portion of property tax revenues in the Statement of Activity. This
was based on a funded pupil count of 89,746 and per pupil total program funding of $8,353 compared to
total program funding of $796.9 million funded pupil count of 91,185 and per pupil total program funding
of $8,739 in FY 2020. Of the adjusted total program funding, $182.5 million was funded through state
share compared to $239.0 million in FY 2020. The remainder was funded through a combination of local
property and specific ownership taxes.
The District generated $997.4 million in property tax revenues in FY 2021 compared to $956.9 million in
FY 2020. Total property tax revenues include School Finance Act mills, override election mills, Tax
Abatement mills and Bond Redemption Fund mills. Tax revenues increased by $43.6 million and are
attributable to the rising property valuations in the City and County of Denver, partially offset by a
decrease in state equalization of $56.5 million. District grants operating revenue increased by $84.0
million year over year due to CARES funding grants of Coronavirus Relief Fund, Elementary and
Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, and Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. Total expenses
for the primary government in FY 2021 were $1,485.6 million compared to $1,413.1 million in FY 2020.
Total expenses increased by $72.6 million partially due to an increase in PERA employer contributions as
well as salary increases for hourly employees and teachers following the 2019 renegotiated teacher
contract.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
The Grant Special Revenue Fund balance as of June 30, 2021 was $16.3 million compared to $14.8 million
at June 30, 2020. The fund balance is restricted to the District’s grant funded programs that generated
the fund balance.
The Bond Redemption Fund balance as of June 30, 2021 was $224.0 million compared to $201.8 million
as of June 30, 2020. The Bond Redemption Fund is restricted for payment of the District’s General
Obligation Bond debt service as authorized by Denver voters.
The Building Fund as of June 30, 2021 was $502.8 million compared to $183.0 million as of June 30,
2020. The Building Fund consists of unspent proceeds from issuance of voter approved general obligation
bonds and is restricted for financing projects as described in the respective ballot language.
The Capital Reserve Fund as of June 30, 2021 was $72.9 million compared to $73.4 million as of June 30,
2020. The Capital Reserve Fund consists of unspent COPs restricted for financing capital projects and for
debt service. Additionally, a portion of Capital Reserve Fund is restricted for capital projects by Board
authorization and assigned to debt service by Board adoption of the annual budget.
The Building Fund increased by $319.8 million as a result of the issuance of the 2021 general obligation
bond. Capital Reserve Fund decreased by $(0.5) million as a result of the certificates of participation
capital expenditures. The Bond Redemption Fund increased $22.2 million due to the increase in property
tax. The Grant Special Reserve Fund increased $1.5 million, due to receiving federal COVID-19 relief
funds for lost tuition revenue for EGTC students.
Proprietary funds
The District’s proprietary funds are prepared on full accrual basis, but in more detail. The fund statements
show the Internal Service Fund, the District’s only proprietary fund, which is included with the
governmental activities for the government-wide financial statements.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
In accordance with state law, the District’s budget is prepared on a GAAP basis. The most significant
budgeted fund is the General Fund.
The difference between the General Fund original and final budget for expenditures decreased by $34.5
million to account for reduced revenue received due to enrollment changes from original projections,
specifically due to COVID-19 enrollment declines.
As a result of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the District faced economic uncertainties which
impacted the budget. Classrooms remained mostly remote during the first semester with a return to
in-person schooling phased in during the second half of the year. This resulted in the District realizing
savings in operational costs due to the closure of buildings, specifically in Transportation and Utilities. In
addition, the District received federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security
(CARES) Act, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA), and the
American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to help cover costs related to the District's response to and recovery
from the COVID-19 pandemic. The District had increased unplanned expenses for technology, personal
protective equipment (PPE), and COVID-19 testing that were paid by the CARES funding. In addition, as
revenues for student meals and before and after care programs went down, stimulus funding covered
these expenses to provide free breakfast and lunch to students and their families, as well as ensuring
students had safe learning places and in order to allow families to return to work.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
The amended budget included a general fund reduction in fund balance of $11.9M. The actual change to
fund balance for general fund was a $6.1M increase, an $18.0M difference from what was included in the
budget. The cause of this variance includes $13.4M more revenue received due to a State Equalization
Supplemental Payment announced after the amended budget had been finalized along with the State
deciding to pay an additional monthly Equalization payment at fiscal year end instead of holding the
payment back in place of Federal Stimulus funds. This additional revenue, along with the savings realized
during operational closures and with stimulus funding, resulted in the district’s ability to increase fund
balance during the budget year.
Capital Assets and Debt Administration
Capital assets
The District’s investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation for its governmental activities
as of June 30, 2021 amounted to $1,612.2 million. Investment in capital assets includes land, buildings
and improvements, equipment, capital leases and construction in progress with an original cost greater
than $5,000 and an estimated useful life longer than one year.
The major capital events during the current fiscal year included spending on capital projects in the
Building and Capital Reserve Funds. Capital projects are used to make improvements and critical repairs.
The District’s total capital assets at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, net of accumulated
depreciation, were as follows (in millions).
June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial
statements. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred,
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the fiscal year
for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility
requirements imposed by the provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the District’s governmental activities and component
units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the
various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the
District considers grant revenues to be available if they are collected within 180 days of the fiscal
year-end. Property tax and other revenues are considered available if collected within 60 days of the
year-end. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting.
However, debt service expenditures as well as expenditures related to compensated absences, pension
and OPEB are recorded only when payment is due.
The District’s fiduciary funds apply the accrual basis of accounting and the economic resources
measurement focus.
The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing
accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenue and expenditures or expenses as
appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are needed.
Governmental Funds
The District reports the following major governmental funds:
The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial
resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as detailed below. Primary revenue
sources for the general fund include property taxes, state equalization, and tuition billing for early
childhood education.
The Grants Special Revenue Fund is used for the revenues and expenditures related to federal, state, and
local grants. Special Revenue funds are used to account for proceeds of special revenue sources that are
legally or otherwise restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. Revenue restrictions in this fund are
imposed by the grantor for the specific purposes of the grant.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
The Bond Redemption Fund (debt service fund) accounts for and reports financial resources that are
restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-term general obligation debt of the District as
a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
The Building Fund is a capital projects fund and accounts for construction and renovation projects funded
by the sale of general obligation bonds. Debt payments on certain certificates of participation are also
accounted for here.
The Capital Reserve Fund is a capital projects fund and accounts for ongoing capital outlay needs of the
District such as repairs and maintenance including proceeds from the issuance of COP's.
The District reports the following nonmajor governmental funds:
The Food Services Special Revenue Fund accounts for the revenue and expenses related to providing
students with healthy and nutritious meals. Revenue sources for this fund include federal and state grants
and private sources.
The Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fundaccounts for the revenue and expenditures of sponsoring athletic
events at District middle and high schools. The fund also represents school sponsored student activities
managed at the school level.
The Operations Technology Special Revenue Fund accounts for the proceeds of voter approved taxes
from the 2020 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are dedicated to maintenance
operations and technology improvements.
The ProComp Special Revenue Fund is a blended component unit used to account for the proceeds of
voter approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are the
professional compensation system of the teachers.
The Permanent Fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent that
only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the District’s programs.
Internal Service and Fiduciary Funds
The Internal Service Fund is used to account for goods and services provided to departments and schools
primarily within the District on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Proprietary (internal service) Funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non operating.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services or producing and delivering
goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the District’s internal service fund are charges to customers for sales and services. Operating
expenses for the internal service fund include the cost of sales and services and administrative expenses.
The District has two Fiduciary Funds which include the Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund and the Private
Purpose Trust Fund. The Private Purpose Trust Fund is used to report all fiduciary activities that are not
required to be reported in pension and other employee benefit trust funds or investment trust funds and
are held in trust. The Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund is used to report the MetLife Retiree Life
Insurance OPEB Plan since the assets are administered through a trust in which Denver Public Schools is
not a beneficiary, dedicated to providing benefits to retirees or designated beneficiaries in accordance
with the benefit terms, and legally protected from the creditors of Denver Public Schools. The District

Accrued Payroll
The accrued payroll represents payment in arrears earned as of June 30 as well as the liability to teachers
and certain other employees who earn their salaries over the school year but are paid over a
twelve-month period from August 1 to July 31. Changes in the accrual are reflected in expenditures or
expenses on the applicable fund's statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances.
Certain payroll benefits and part-time salaries which are payable at June 30 are also included.
Encumbrances
Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the
expenditures of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation, is
employed as an extension of formal budgetary integration in all funds.
Compensated Absences
The compensated absence liability including payroll taxes, reported on the government-wide financial
statements consists of accumulated sick and vacation leave which vests and is payable upon termination
or retirement. Accumulated sick leave vests only at qualified retirement and vests as a rate determined by
contract, which is less than the normal rate of pay. A qualified retiree can be paid for up to one
work-years' worth of accumulated sick leave. Retirees who accumulate vacation leave are compensated
at their normal rate of pay for the balance at retirement. On the fund financial statements, compensated
absence amounts are reported as expenditures or expenses, as appropriate, when paid.
Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements and proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements,
long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities or proprietary fund type statement of net position. Debt premiums and discounts are deferred
and amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
interest method. The appropriate obligations are reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and discounts during
the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums
received on debt issuance are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuance are
reported as other financing uses. In accordance with Section 22-45-103, CRS, the District’s bond
redemption fund custodian for FY 2021 was U.S. Bank.
Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities, GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement
No. 27 and GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits
other than Pensions, the government-wide statements include deferred outflows of resources
representing the deferred loss on refunding of the District’s certificates of participation and bond
obligations and items relating to the District’s pension and OPEB obligations. Deferred inflows of
resources relate to deferred gain on refunding, pension, and OPEB obligations. Additionally, the
governmental fund financial statements include deferred inflows of resources for property taxes
receivable and long-term receivables that have not met modified accrual revenue recognition criteria.

Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets, restricted
and unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes amounts for debt service,
performance-based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education, non-governmental
grantor-designated purposes, federal programs, permanent fund and capital projects.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy based
primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for
which amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances, the District considers
amounts to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for which fund balance is both
available and can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54, the fund balances of the District are
classified into the following categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in
spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact, including items that are
not expected to be converted to cash.
Restricted fund balance includes amounts where constraints have been placed on the use of resources by
either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or
laws or regulations of other governments; or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or
enabling legislation.
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to
constraints imposed by the Board of Education. Committed amounts cannot be used for any other
purpose unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of
formal action (for example, resolution) it employed to previously commit those amounts. Committed fund
balance also incorporates contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have
been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.
Assigned fund balance includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be used for
specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. The Board of Education adopted a fund
balance policy and as part of the policy delegated the authority to the Superintendent or designee to
assign amounts to be used for specific purposes.
Unassigned fund balance represents residual fund balance that has not been restricted, committed or
assigned. Positive unassigned fund balance can only be reported in the general fund while negative
unassigned fund balance may be reported in any governmental fund.
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is
available, the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first. When an expenditure is incurred
for which committed, assigned, or unassigned fund balances are available, the District considers amounts
to have been spent first out of committed funds, then assigned funds and finally unassigned funds, as
needed, unless the Board of Education has provided otherwise in its commitment or assignment actions.

Investments Authorized by the Colorado Statutes and District’s Investment Policy
The table below identifies the investment types that are authorized by the District’s investment policy or
Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS), where more restrictive. The table also identifies certain provisions of the
District’s investment policy that address interest rate risk, credit risk and concentration of credit risk. The
table does not address the investments of (a) debt proceeds that are governed by the provisions of the debt
agreements of the District, or (b) Special Revenue ProComp Trust assets that are governed by the Trust’s
Investment Policy Statement rather than the general provisions of the District’s investment policy.

*Other than repurchase agreements for investment of general obligation bond proceeds and certificates of
deposit.
As of June 30, 2021, the District investments are in compliance with the investment policy.
Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements
The District invests in various investment securities that are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is possible that changes in the
values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such change could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.
The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally
accepted accounting principles. The valuation is based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the
asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are inputs other
than those within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 inputs are significant
unobservable inputs.
63

--- PAGE 64 ---

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
The District has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2021:
 Corporate Notes of $155,175,604 are valued using quoted market price or other observable
inputs (Level 1 and 2 inputs).
 Commercial Paper of $85,957,389 are valued using quoted market price or other observable
inputs (Level 1 and 2 inputs).
 U.S. Treasury securities of $78,596,849 are valued using quoted price in active markets for
identical assets (Level 1 inputs).
 Repurchase Agreements of $31,625,185 are valued using pricing models (Level 2 inputs).
Custodial Credit Risk
Colorado law requires the District to use eligible public depositories as defined by the Public Deposit
Protection Act of 1989 (the Act). Under the Act, the depository is required to pledge eligible collateral having
a market value at all times equal to 102% of the aggregate public depositories not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Eligible collateral as defined by the Act primarily includes obligations of, or
guarantees by, the U.S. government, the State of Colorado or any political subdivision thereof and
obligations evidenced by notes secured by first lien mortgages of trust on real property.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District will not be able to recover its
deposits nor the collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.
The District’s deposits are with eligible public depositories and are considered to be held in the name of the
District. These deposits have bank balances of $5,510,217 and related carrying amount of $7,819,287.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest rates. The
District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the Colorado Revised
Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing a combination of shorter and
longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is either
maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed by operations and

Actuarial assumptions.The total OPEB liability in the July 1, 2020 actuarial valuation was determined
using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless
otherwise specified:
Actuarial cost method Entry Age Normal
Last experience study Not applicable since only standard tables are
used due to credibility constraints for actual
experience.
Long-term investment rate of return, net of OPEB
plan investment expenses, including price inflation 2.90 percent
Discount rate 2.90 percent
Mortality table - 2010 Pub General Healthy Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate Scale and 2010 Pub
General Disabled Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate
The plan does not have enough credible data to develop a mortality assumption. As a result, the plan
must rely on publicly available mortality tables. The Society of Actuaries recently published and
recommends using both 2010 Pub General Healthy Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate scale and 2010 Pub
General Disabled Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate scale.
Discount rate. The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 2.90%. The discount rate
is based on management assumptions and estimates of asset composition, and long-term expected
interest rate returns. In estimating the discount rate the District is convinced the OPEB plan’s fiduciary net
position is projected to be sufficient to make projected benefit payments and OPEB plan assets are
expected to be invested using a strategy to achieve that return. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB
plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected OPEB payments for
current retirees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied
to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability.
Plan assets. The LIFA Fund is invested in the MetLife General Account and expected return on assets is
based on a combination of the Bloomberg Barclays Capital Government/Credit Bond and the Bloomberg
Barclays Capital Government/Credit Long Indices.

The District has a potential liability relating to the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act),
which is a federally-funded hazardous material/asbestos management program administered by the State
Health Department. It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with the Act, therefore no liability
has been accrued. It is expected that these expenditures will not have a significant impact on the
financial position of the District.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be questioned
as not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to
reimbursement to the grantor agencies. The District's management believes a disallowance, if any, will be
immaterial.
For the year ended June 30, 2021, the District reported a deficit net position of $1,007,436,104 in the
government-wide statements. This deficit can be partially attributed to the implementation of GASB 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27 and
GASB 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions
requiring the recognition of a long-term liability for pensions and postemployment benefits other than
pensions respectively. The deficit net position can also be attributed to liabilities related to the District’s
Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds are to fund retirement and necessary capital
and maintenance projects of the District’s facilities.
Encumbrances represent a contractual obligation and expenditures are recognized when the goods and
services are delivered and/or received. As of June 30, 2021 encumbrances for the governmental funds
were:
Fund Encumbrances
Building 92,605,225
General 70,620,564
Grant Special Revenue Fund 13,860,896
Capital Reserve 6,675,054
Nonmajor Funds 472,724
Total $ 184,234,463
Building Fund encumbrances include commitments towards major capital maintenance and construction
projects such as but not limited to the demolition and reconstruction of the Montbello campus, electrical,
galvanize piping and irrigation projects at several locations. They also include commitments towards the
implementation of the new ERP management system.
General Fund encumbrances include significant commitments to the District’s health care plans and utility
costs as well as districtwide and school level operations.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DEVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
13. CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS
At the general election held November 1992, voters approved the TABOR amendment to the Colorado
Constitution limiting the ability of the state and local governments such as the District to increase
revenues, debt and spending and restricting property, income and other taxes. In November 1999 the
Denver voters gave the District approval to exceed the spending limits established in TABOR beginning
with the 1999 fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the state and local governments obtain voter
approval to create any "multiple fiscal year direct or indirect debt or other financial obligation whatsoever
without adequate present cash reserves pledged irrevocably and held for payments in all future fiscal
years.” The amendment exempts from its restrictions the borrowings and fiscal operations of enterprises.
Enterprises are defined to include government owned businesses authorized to issue their own revenue
bonds and receiving under 10% of their grants from all state and local government sources combined.
The amendment also requires the establishment of an emergency reserve equal to three percent of fiscal
year spending excluding debt service.
In accordance with TABOR, the District maintains an emergency reserve of 3% of fiscal year spending by
designating real property owned by the District in lieu of cash. For fiscal year 2021, spending was
$1,212,435,775 and the 3% emergency reserve was $36,540,189, which excludes multi-year obligations
of $167,116. Additionally, in accordance with C.R.S. Section 22-44-105, the District established an
emergency cash reserve as a restricted fund balance in the General Fund for $31,697,040 equal to 3% of
budgeted General Fund revenues.

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021
14. COMPONENT UNITS
The District has 29 component units consisting of 3 blended component units and 26 discretely presented
component units. Charter schools are included in the component units as they are fiscally dependent
upon revenues derived from the State per pupil revenue funding calculation.
Change in Reporting Entity
The component units combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity. The changes in
reporting entity include charter schools with expired charters that were not renewed and a new charter.
As of June 30, 2021, The CUBE closed because there is a lack of long term facility options due to current
real estate market conditions. Ridge View Academy is a school attached to a facility which the
state closed over licensing issues. The school had no other students outside of that arrangement.
Blended Component Units
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c) (3) and
501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings and equipment
for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for the creation and
continued management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is ultimately responsible for
any deficits or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation issued by the DSFLC and its
activities for the year are reflected in the accompanying government-wide financial statements of the
District. An evaluation of the DSFLC using the above considerations results in its blended inclusion in the
accompanying financial statements. There are no separate financial statements available for the DSFLC
and the financial information of the DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government which is why
DSFLC is not shown on the schedules in this note.
Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System for Teachers
The Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System (ProComp) was established following the
approval of the 2005 Mill Levy Override as a groundbreaking compensation system that links teacher pay
to the instructional mission of the District. Designed in a partnership between the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association (DCTA) and the District, ProComp has received national attention because it
rewards teachers for their professional accomplishments while linking pay to student achievement. The
financial information of ProComp is blended with that of the primary government, which is why ProComp
is not shown on the schedules in this note. ProComp is presented as a component unit because it is a
separate legal entity and is financially accountable to the District.
Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust
The Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust provides benefits to participants eligible to retire
prior to September 1, 1997. The eligible participants receive a $10,000 retiree life insurance benefit. Life
insurance benefits are not available to anyone who retires after January 1, 2006. Benefits are self-insured
with a retiree plan trust administered by MetLife. DPSRLIT is considered a fiduciary component unit under
the provisions of GASB 14. The Financial Reporting Entity as amended and GASB 84, Fiduciary Activities.
