MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado (the
District), provides readers of the District’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report this narrative overview
and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. We
encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information
that is presented in the letter of transmittal, which starts on page 10 of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the statement of net position, as of June 30, 2023, the District’s net position for governmental
activities is a deficit of $(561.6) million. The deficit net position can be partially attributed to the
implementation of GASB 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions - an amendment of GASB
Statement No. 27 and GASB 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other
Than Pensions requiring the recognition of a long-term liability for pension and postemployment benefits
other than pensions respectively. The deficit net position can also be attributed to liabilities related to the
District's Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds that are to fund retirement and
necessary capital and maintenance projects of the District's facilities. In July of 1997, the District
executed $384.2 million in COPs with the net proceeds contributed to DPSRS. In April of 2008, the District
issued $750 million in COPs to refund existing certificates and to fund an additional $397.8 million
contribution to DPSRS in anticipation of the merger with PERA. As a result of these contributions, the
District’s PERA division is 81.93% funded compared to the PERA School division of 61.79% as of
December 31, 2022.
Long-term liabilities increased to $3,738.8 million from $3,503.6 million in FY 2023 primarily due to the
increase in net pension liability.
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $1,434.7 million or 75% of total revenues
and program revenues were $478.6 million or 25% of the total revenues of the primary government. The
total revenues increased to $1,913.3 million from $1,692.9 million, or 13.0% when compared to prior
year. The change in net position of $159.3 million is partially due to an increase in property tax revenue
of $50.6 million and state share revenue increase of $41.8 million.
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide
financial statements, 2) fund financial statements and 3) notes to the basic financial statements. This
report also contains required supplementary information and other supplementary information.
Government-wide Statements
The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with information about the
District as a whole using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector businesses.
The statement of net position includes District assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and
deferred inflows of resources, with differences reported as net position to the exclusion of fiduciary funds.
The statement of activities presents information on how the District’s net position changed during the
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported when the underlying event giving rise to the change
occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in
this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected
taxes and retiree sick leave payable).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023
In the government-wide financial statements the District’s activities are shown as:
Governmental activities: Most of the District’s basic services are included here, such as instruction,
transportation, operations and maintenance and administration. Taxes principally support these activities.
The government-wide financial statements encompass not only the District itself (the primary
government) but also legally-separate entities including the ProComp Special Revenue Fund, Denver
School Facilities Leasing Corporation, Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust and Private
Purpose Trust as blended component units and Denver Public Schools Foundation and charter schools as
discretely presented component units.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts used to maintain control over resources that have been
segregated for specific activities or objectives. The fund financial statements provide more detailed
information about the District’s operations, focusing on its most significant or major funds, not the District
as a whole. The District has two types of funds: governmental funds and fiduciary funds.
Governmental funds: Most of the District’s services are included in governmental funds, which
generally focus on how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flows and
the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds
statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine the status of financial resources that
can be spent in the near future to finance the District’s programs.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. Thus,
readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.
Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to the government-wide financial
statements in order to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental
activities. The District maintains nine individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately
in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances for the General, Grants Special Revenue, Bond Redemption
(debt service), and Building, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data for the other five
governmental funds (Pupil Activity Special Revenue, Food Services Special Revenue, ProComp Special
Revenue, Mill Levy Technology Maintenance and Permanent) are combined into a single, aggregated
presentation. Individual fund data for each of these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the form
of combining statements included in this report.
Fiduciary funds: The District has two Fiduciary funds which include the Other Employee Benefit Trust
and the Private Purpose Trust Fund. Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held by the District
in a fiduciary capacity and can only be used for specified purposes. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in
the government-wide financial statement because the resources of those funds are not available to
support the District’s programs.
Notes to the basic financial statements: The notes provide additional information essential to a full
understanding of the data provided in the financial statements.
Other information: In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report
presents required supplementary information and other supplementary information.

The required supplemental information includes the District’s annual appropriated budgets with
comparison schedules that demonstrate compliance with budgets for the General Fund and Special
Revenue Funds. The schedule of changes in the collective net pension liability and OPEB liability are
provided next, followed by notes to required supplementary information.
The other supplementary information includes the combining statements in connection with nonmajor
governmental funds and budgetary comparison schedules. In addition, fiduciary fund information is
presented.
Financial Analysis of the District
Increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of the District’s overall financial
position. The District's net position increased $159.3 million partially due to an increase in property tax
revenue of $50.6 million and state share revenue increase of $41.8 million. Additionally, there are several
other measures that indicate a sustainable financial position, including:
 The District has the largest and most diverse tax base in the State of Colorado with $21.8 billion
of net assessed value.
 General fund balance increased $14.2 million in FY 2023, with ending fund balance of $147.7
million.
 In November of 2020, Denver voters approved a mill levy override of $32 million. The increased
funding will go towards increasing minimum wage and other compensation, mental health
professionals, nursing services, special education services and charter share (required by law).
 In November of 2020, Denver voters approved an up to $795 million bond to invest in critical
maintenance, constructing new schools and additions to existing schools, upgrading learning
environments in older schools and increasing student technology access.
 The 2020 voter approved general bond obligations were issued in 2021 and 2022 with the
following ratings:
 Moody’s ratings of Aa2
 Fitch ratings of AA+
 S&P ratings of AA+
A significant portion of the District’s assets are its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings,
equipment, lease of tangible assets and software-based information technology arrangement assets). The
District uses these assets to provide instruction and related services to its students. Capital, lease and
software assets (net) increased to $1,762.3 million in FY 2023 from $1,644.7 million in FY 2022. The
increase is primarily a result of capital spending from the District’s general obligation bonds and
certificates of participation. The District’s capital assets will continue to increase as planned projects are
completed in the Building Fund (starting fiscal year 2023 the capital reserve fund combined with the
building fund). This fund has an available fund balance of $682.8 million.

Most revenues to Colorado's school districts are provided through the Public School Finance Act of 1994
(as amended). The District’s adjusted total program funding for FY 2023 was $886.1 million reflected as a
combination of state equalization and a portion of property tax revenues in the Statement of Activity. This
was based on a funded pupil count of 89,176 and per pupil total program funding of $9,936 compared to
total program funding of $837.2 million funded pupil count of 89,410 and per pupil total program funding
of $9,364 in FY 2022. Of the adjusted total program funding, $264.1 million was funded through state
share compared to $222.3 million in FY 2022. The remainder was funded through a combination of local
property and specific ownership taxes.
The District generated $1,076.8 million in property tax revenues in FY 2023 compared to $1,026.2 million
in FY 2022. Total property tax revenues include School Finance Act mills, override election mills, Tax
Abatement mills and Bond Redemption Fund mills. Property tax revenues increased by $50.6 million and
are attributable to the rising property valuations in the City and County of Denver. The District also
recognized an increase in state equalization of $41.8 million. District grants operating revenue increased
by $104.9 million year over year due to a second phase of Elementary and Secondary School Emergency
Relief Fund. Total expenses for the primary government in FY 2023 were $1,754.0 million compared to
$1,406.4 million in FY 2022. Total expenses increased by $347.6 million primarily due to increased spend
in student instruction and student support services.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023
The Grant Special Revenue Fund balance as of June 30, 2023 was $22.1 million compared to $17.4 million
at June 30, 2022. The fund balance is restricted to the District’s grant funded programs that generated
the fund balance.
The Bond Redemption Fund balance as of June 30, 2023 was $226.6 million compared to $220.9 million
as of June 30, 2022. The Bond Redemption Fund is restricted for payment of the District’s General
Obligation Bond debt service as authorized by Denver voters. The Bond Redemption Fund increased by
$5.7 million due to timing of upcoming debt service payments.
The Building Fund as of June 30, 2023 was $682.8 million compared to $869.6 million as of June 30,
2022, as restated. The Building Fund consists of unspent proceeds from issuance of voter approved
general obligation bonds and is restricted for financing projects as described in the respective ballot
language. The Building Fund also consists of unspent Certificates of Participation (COPs) restricted for
financing capital projects and for debt service. Additionally, a portion of these funds is restricted for
capital projects by Board authorization and assigned to debt service by Board adoption of the annual
budget. Starting fiscal year 2023 the capital reserve fund has been combined with the building fund, as
noted by the change in reporting entity. The Building Fund decreased by $186.8 million primarily as a
result of continuing to spend down the 2020 general obligation bond and COPs.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
In accordance with state law, the District’s budget is prepared on a GAAP basis. The most significant
budgeted fund is the General Fund.
The difference between the General Fund original and final budget for expenditures, excluding reserves,
increased by $3.7 million due to additional allocation of funds to schools and school support services.
The actual change to fund balance for general fund was a $14.2 million increase, a $23.4 million
difference from what was included in the budget compared to prior year. The main factor driving the
difference was related to district-managed schools underspending their budgets mainly due to vacant
positions and additional revenue from higher interest rates creating additional interest income and higher
local specific ownership tax revenues.
Capital and Lease/Software Assets and Debt Administration
Capital and Lease/Software Assets
The District’s investment in capital assets and lease/software assets, net of accumulated depreciation for
its governmental activities as of June 30, 2023 amounted to $1,762.3 million. Investment in capital assets
includes land, buildings and improvements, equipment, right to use lease tangible assets and
software-based information technology (SBITA) intangible assets, and construction in progress with an
original cost greater than $25,000 and an estimated useful life longer than one year.
The major capital events during the current fiscal year included spending on capital projects in the
Building Fund which included implementation of the new Enterprise Resource Planning Oracle system.
Capital projects are used to make improvements and critical repairs. In fiscal year 2023, the District
implemented GASB 96 (Statement No. 96) software-based information technology arrangements
reporting requirements for all state and local governments where the District is named the lessee of
intangible assets. The District will recognize a SBITA liability within the government-wide financial
statements.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting as is the fiduciary fund financial statements. Revenues are
recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of
related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the fiscal year for which they are levied.
Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the
provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the District’s governmental activities and component
units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the
various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the
District considers grant and state revenues to be available if they are collected within 180 days of the
fiscal year-end. Property tax and other revenues are considered available if collected within 60 days of the
year-end. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting.
However, debt service expenditures as well as expenditures related to compensated absences, pension
and OPEB are recorded only when payment is due.
The District’s fiduciary funds apply the accrual basis of accounting and the economic resources
measurement focus.
The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing
accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, fund equity, revenue and
expenditures or expenses as appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in
individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which
spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are needed.
Governmental Funds
The District reports the following major governmental funds:
The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial
resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as detailed below. Primary revenue
sources for the general fund include property taxes, state equalization, and tuition billing for early
childhood education. The internal service fund was combined into the general fund starting the fiscal year
2023. The district is no longer providing goods or services on a cost reimbursement basis.
The Grants Special Revenue Fund is used for the revenues and expenditures related to federal, state, and
local grants. Special Revenue funds are used to account for proceeds of special revenue sources that are
55

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023
legally or otherwise restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. Revenue restrictions in this fund are
imposed by the grantor for the specific purposes of the grant.
The Bond Redemption Fund (debt service fund) accounts for and reports financial resources that are
restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-term general obligation debt of the District as
a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
The Building Fund is a capital projects fund and accounts for ongoing capital outlay needs of the District
such as construction, renovation projects, repairs and maintenance funded by the sale of general
obligation bonds and proceeds from the issuance of certificates of participation (COPs). Debt payments on
certain COPs are also accounted for here. The capital reserve fund was combined into the building fund
starting fiscal year 2023. The Building and Capital Reserve Funds were combined into a single fund to
promote efficiencies of managing capital in a single fund while maintaining capabilities of project level
reporting at the funding level as allowed by state statute.
The District reports the following nonmajor governmental funds:
The Food Services Special Revenue Fund accounts for the revenue and expenses related to providing
students with healthy and nutritious meals. Revenue sources for this fund include federal and state grants
and private sources.
The Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fundaccounts for the revenue and expenditures of sponsoring athletic
events at District middle and high schools. The fund also represents school sponsored student activities
managed at the school level.
The Mill Levy Technology Maintenance Special Revenue Fundaccounts for the proceeds of voter approved
taxes from the 2020 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are dedicated to maintenance
operations and technology improvements.
The ProComp Special Revenue Fund is a blended component unit used to account for the proceeds of
voter approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are the
professional compensation system of the teachers.
The Permanent Fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent that
only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the District’s programs.
Fiduciary Funds
The District has two Fiduciary Funds which include the Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund and the Private
Purpose Trust Fund. The Private Purpose Trust Fund is used to report all fiduciary activities that are not
required to be reported in pension and other employee benefit trust funds or investment trust funds and
are held in trust. The Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund is used to report the MetLife Retiree Life
Insurance OPEB Plan since the assets are administered through a trust in which Denver Public Schools is
not a beneficiary, dedicated to providing benefits to retirees or designated beneficiaries in accordance
with the benefit terms, and legally protected from the creditors of Denver Public Schools. The District
included the Retiree Life Insurance trust as a fiduciary component unit in its financial statements. The
District’s postemployment health benefits were transferred to PERACare on January 1, 2010. See Note 10
for additional information for OPEB Retiree Life Insurance Plan.

twelve-month period from August 1 to July 31. Changes in the accrual are reflected in expenditures or
expenses on the applicable fund's statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances.
Certain payroll benefits and part-time salaries which are payable at June 30 are also included.
Encumbrances
Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the
expenditures of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation, is
employed as an extension of formal budgetary integration in all funds.
Compensated Absences
The compensated absence liability including payroll taxes, reported on the government-wide financial
statements consists of accumulated sick and vacation leave which vests and is payable upon termination
or retirement. Accumulated sick leave vests only at qualified retirement and vests as a rate determined by
contract, which is less than the normal rate of pay. A qualified retiree can be paid for up to one
work-years' worth of accumulated sick leave. Retirees who accumulate vacation leave are compensated
at their normal rate of pay for the balance at retirement. On the fund financial statements, compensated
absence amounts are reported as expenditures or expenses, as appropriate, when paid.
Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are
reported as liabilities. Debt premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the debt
using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The appropriate
obligations are reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and discounts during
the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums
received on debt issuance are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuance are
reported as other financing uses. In accordance with Section 22-45-103, CRS, the District’s bond
redemption fund custodian for FY 2023 was U.S. Bank.
Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities, GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement
No. 27 , GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits other
than Pensions and GASB Statement No. 87 Leases the government-wide statements include deferred
outflows of resources representing the deferred loss on refunding of the District’s certificates of
participation and bond obligations and items relating to the District’s pension and OPEB obligations.
Deferred inflows of resources relate to deferred gain on refunding, pension, OPEB obligations and leases.
Additionally, the governmental fund financial statements include deferred inflows of resources for
property taxes receivable and long-term receivables that have not met modified accrual revenue
recognition criteria.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023
Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets, restricted
and unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes amounts for debt service,
performance-based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education, non-governmental
grantor-designated purposes, and capital projects.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy based
primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for
which amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances, the District considers
amounts to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for which fund balance is both
available and can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54, the fund balances of the District are
classified into the following categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in
spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact, including items that are
not expected to be converted to cash.
Restricted fund balance includes amounts where constraints have been placed on the use of resources by
either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or
laws or regulations of other governments; or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or
enabling legislation.
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to
constraints imposed by the Board of Education. Committed amounts cannot be used for any other
purpose unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of
formal action (for example, resolution) it employed to previously commit those amounts. Committed fund
balance also incorporates contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have
been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.
Assigned fund balance includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be used for
specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. The Board of Education adopted a fund
balance policy and as part of the policy delegated the authority to the Superintendent or designee to
assign amounts to be used for specific purposes.
Unassigned fund balance represents residual fund balance that has not been restricted, committed or
assigned. Positive unassigned fund balance can only be reported in the general fund while negative
unassigned fund balance may be reported in any governmental fund.
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is
available, the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first. When an expenditure is incurred
for which committed, assigned, or unassigned fund balances are available, the District considers amounts
to have been spent first out of committed funds, then assigned funds and finally unassigned funds, as
needed, unless the Board of Education has provided otherwise in its commitment or assignment actions.

2. CASH AND INVESTMENTS
Investments Authorized by the Colorado Statutes and District’s Investment Policy
The table below identifies the investment types that are authorized by the District’s investment policy or
Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS), where more restrictive. The table also identifies certain provisions of the
District’s investment policy that address interest rate risk, credit risk and concentration of credit risk. The
table does not address the investments of (a) debt proceeds that are governed by the provisions of the debt
agreements of the District, or (b) Special Revenue ProComp Trust assets that are governed by the Trust’s
Investment Policy Statement rather than the general provisions of the District’s investment policy.

Guaranteed Investment Contracts C.R.S. 24-75-601 N/A N/A
*Other than repurchase agreements for investment of general obligation bond proceeds and certificates of
deposit.
As of June 30, 2023, the District investments are in compliance with the investment policy.
Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements
The District invests in various investment securities that are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is possible that changes in the
values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such change could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.
The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally
accepted accounting principles. The valuation is based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the
asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are inputs other
than those within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 inputs are significant
unobservable inputs.
61

--- PAGE 62 ---

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023
The District has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2023:
 Corporate Notes of $125,104,298 are valued using quoted market price or other observable
inputs (Level 1 and 2 inputs).
 U.S. Treasury securities of $361,614,378 are valued using quoted price in active markets for
identical assets (Level 1 inputs).
 Repurchase Agreements of $38,475,000 are valued using pricing models (Level 2 inputs).
Custodial Credit Risk
Colorado law requires the District to use eligible public depositories as defined by the Public Deposit
Protection Act of 1989 (the Act). Under the Act, the depository is required to pledge eligible collateral having
a market value at all times equal to 102% of the aggregate public depositories not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Eligible collateral as defined by the Act primarily includes obligations of, or
guarantees by, the U.S. government, the State of Colorado or any political subdivision thereof and
obligations evidenced by notes secured by first lien mortgages of trust on real property.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District will not be able to recover its
deposits nor the collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.
The District’s deposits are with eligible public depositories and are considered to be held in the name of the
District. These deposits have bank balances of $16,638,691 and related carrying amount of $4,708,098.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest rates. The
District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the Colorado Revised
Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing a combination of shorter and
longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is either
maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed by operations and
debt service requirements.
The following table shows the distribution of the District’s cash and cash equivalents and investments by
maturity, which displays the sensitivity of the fair values of the District’s investments, including investments
held by bond trustee, to market rate fluctuations:

On May 1, 2013, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $58.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013C. The certificates provided funding of various projects in the Stapleton Urban
Redevelopment Area including the acquisition, improvement, and placement in service of one additional
District elementary and K-8 schools. Also included were various improvements to the high school and
sports field. The District and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority have entered into a 2013 Supplemental

projects which will serve as the source of repayment for the Series 2013C Certificates of Participation.
In September of 2015, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $8.6 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2015B. The proceeds were used for the purchase of the parking garage located at
1855 Lincoln Street in downtown Denver and the land upon which it is located. The primary purpose is to
provide affordable and long-term parking for the users of the Emily Griffith Campus. The Certificates
explain undivided interests in the right to receive certain revenues payable by the District under an
annually renewed Lease Purchase Agreement dated on October 5, 2015.
In May of 2017, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $32 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2017A and $14 million of Certificates of Participation, Series 2017B. The purpose of
the 2017A issuance was to construct the Stapleton Park Street School, an elementary school located in
the Stapleton neighborhood of Denver. The proceeds from 2017B issuance were used to purchase a
school site for the Stapleton Park Street School and to help fund the design and construction cost of a fire
station near the school site to meet safety standards for DPS schools within Stapleton.
In November of 2017, as authorized by the Board resolution, the District issued $10 million Refunding
Certificate of Participation, Series 2017C. The proceeds for the issuance in combination with the proceeds
received from the sale of Emily Griffith Opportunity School properties were used for the refunding of
$35.2 million of 2013A Certificate of Participation.
In February of 2018, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $7.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2018. The proceeds were used to purchase a building located at 1617 South Acoma
Street in Denver and the site upon which it is located. The Acoma building currently houses 150 District
employees in the Planning, Design and Construction, Library Services, JROTC, Extended Learning and
Community Schools departments.

In setting the long-term expected rate of return, projections employed to model future returns provide
a range of expected long-term returns that, including expected inflation, ultimately support a long-term
expected nominal rate of return assumption of 7.25 percent.
Discount rate. The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.25 percent. The
projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate applied the actuarial cost method and
assumptions shown above. In addition, the following methods and assumptions were used in the
projection of cash flows:
 Total covered payroll for the initial projection year consists of the covered payroll of the active
membership present on the valuation date and the covered payroll of future plan members
assumed to be hired during the year. In subsequent projection years, total covered payroll was
assumed to increase annually at a rate of 3.00 percent.
 Employee contributions were assumed to be made at the member contribution rates in effect for
each year, including the scheduled increases in SB 18-200 and required adjustments resulting
from the 2018 and 2020 AAP assessments. Employee contributions for future plan members were
used to reduce the estimated amount of total service costs for future plan members.
 Employer contributions were assumed to be made at rates equal to the fixed statutory rates
specified in law for each year, including the scheduled increase in SB 18-200 and required
adjustments resulting from the 2018 and 2020 AAP assessments. Employer contributions also
include current and estimated future AED and SAED, until the actuarial value funding ratio
reaches 103%, at which point the AED and SAED will each drop 0.50% every year until they are
zero. Additionally, estimated employer contributions reflect reductions for the funding of the AIR
and retiree health care benefits. For future plan members, employer contributions were further
reduced by the estimated amount of total service costs for future plan members not financed by
their member contributions.
 Employer contributions for the DPS Division are reduced by an amount equal to the principal
payments plus interest necessary each year to finance the pension certificates of participation
(PCOPs) issued in 1997 and 2008 and refinanced thereafter.
 As specified in law, the State, as a nonemployer contributing entity, will provide an annual direct
distribution of $225 million (actual dollars), commencing July 1, 2018, that is proportioned
between the State, School, Judicial, and DPS Division Trust Funds based upon the covered payroll
of each Division. The annual direct distribution ceases when all Division Trust Funds are fully
funded.

The District has a potential liability relating to the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act),
which is a federally-funded hazardous material/asbestos management program administered by the State
Health Department. It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with the Act, therefore no liability
has been accrued. It is expected that these expenditures will not have a significant impact on the
financial position of the District.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be questioned
as not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to
reimbursement to the grantor agencies. The District's management believes a disallowance, if any, will be
immaterial.
For the year ended June 30, 2023, the District reported a deficit net position of $561,555,537 in the
government-wide statements. This deficit can be partially attributed to the implementation of GASB 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27 and
GASB 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions
requiring the recognition of a long-term liability for pensions and postemployment benefits other than
pensions respectively. The deficit net position can also be attributed to liabilities related to the District’s
Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds to fund retirement and necessary capital and
maintenance projects of the District’s facilities.
Encumbrances represent a contractual obligation and expenditures are recognized when the goods and
services are delivered and/or received. As of June 30, 2023 encumbrances for the governmental funds
were:
Fund Encumbrances
General 52,357,970
Grant Special Revenue Fund 16,148,398
Building Fund 205,637,802
Nonmajor Funds 1,977,931
Total $ 276,122,101
General Fund encumbrances include utilities, commitments to the District’s health care plans as well as
districtwide and school level operations.
Grant Special Revenue Fund comprises commitments for literacy professional services, summer school
tuition assistance and student technology devices.
Building Fund encumbrances include commitments towards major capital maintenance and construction
projects such as but not limited to construction of the new Montbello and Ceylon campus, DSA South
Remodel and Martin Luther King gym and soccer field. Other major commitments for heating ventilation
and cooling projects at Stedman, Wyman, Carson, Whiteman, Place Bridge, Fallis, Sabin and Thomas
Jefferson. Also included are commitments towards the implementation of the new Enterprise Resource
Planning management system.
Nonmajor Fund encumbrances inlcude commitments for food services and athletics equipment.

14. CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS
At the general election held November 1992, voters approved the TABOR amendment to the Colorado
Constitution limiting the ability of the state and local governments such as the District to increase
revenues, debt and spending and restricting property, income and other taxes. In November 1999 the
Denver voters gave the District approval to exceed the spending limits established in TABOR beginning
with the 1999 fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the state and local governments obtain voter
approval to create any "multiple fiscal year direct or indirect debt or other financial obligation whatsoever
without adequate present cash reserves pledged irrevocably and held for payments in all future fiscal
years.” The amendment exempts from its restrictions the borrowings and fiscal operations of enterprises.
Enterprises are defined to include government owned businesses authorized to issue their own revenue
bonds and receiving under 10% of their grants from all state and local government sources combined.
The amendment also requires the establishment of an emergency reserve equal to three percent of fiscal
year spending excluding debt service.
In accordance with TABOR, the District maintains an emergency reserve of 3% of fiscal year spending by
designating real property owned by the District in lieu of cash. For fiscal year 2023, spending was
$1,466,768,935 and the 3% emergency reserve was $44,003,068, which excludes multi-year obligations
of $309,116. Additionally, in accordance with C.R.S. Section 22-44-105, the District established an
emergency cash reserve as a restricted fund balance in the General Fund for $38,060,520 equal to 3% of
budgeted General Fund revenues. The remaining $5.9 million of the emergency reserve is secured by
physical property.

15. COMPONENT UNITS
The District has 27 component units consisting of 3 blended component units and 24 discretely presented
component units. Charter schools are included in the component units as they are fiscally dependent
upon revenues derived from the State per pupil revenue funding calculation.
Change in Reporting Entity
The component units combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity. The changes in
reporting entity include charter schools that closed.
As of June 30, 2023, REACH Charter School was closed due to staffing and academic challenges. REACH
charter's Board of director's voted to surrender their charter.
Blended Component Units
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c) (3) and
501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings and equipment
for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for the creation and
continued management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is ultimately responsible for
any deficits or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation issued by the DSFLC and its
activities for the year are reflected in the accompanying government-wide financial statements of the
District. An evaluation of the DSFLC using the above considerations results in its blended inclusion in the
accompanying financial statements. There are no separate financial statements available for the DSFLC
and the financial information of the DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government which is why
DSFLC is not shown on the schedules in this note.
Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System for Teachers
The Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System (ProComp) was established following the
approval of the 2005 Mill Levy Override as a groundbreaking compensation system that links teacher pay
to the instructional mission of the District. Designed in a partnership between the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association (DCTA) and the District, ProComp has received national attention because it
rewards teachers for their professional accomplishments while linking pay to student achievement. The
financial information of ProComp is blended with that of the primary government, which is why ProComp
is not shown on the schedules in this note. ProComp is presented as a component unit because it is a
separate legal entity and is financially accountable to the District.
Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust
The Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust provides benefits to participants eligible to retire
prior to September 1, 1997. The eligible participants receive a $10,000 retiree life insurance benefit. Life
insurance benefits are not available to anyone who retires after January 1, 2006. Benefits are self-insured
with a retiree plan trust administered by MetLife. DPSRLIT is considered a fiduciary component unit under
the provisions of GASB 14, The Financial Reporting Entity as amended and GASB 84, Fiduciary Activities.
