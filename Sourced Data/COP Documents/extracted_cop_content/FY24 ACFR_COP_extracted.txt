MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado (the
District), provides readers of the District’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report this narrative overview
and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We
encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information
that is presented in the letter of transmittal, which starts on page 10 of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the statement of net position, as of June 30, 2024, the District’s net position for governmental
activities is a deficit of $357.5 million. The deficit net position can be partially attributed to liabilities
related to the District's Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds that are to fund
retirement and necessary capital and maintenance projects of the District's facilities as well as the
District's net pension liability. The entire negative net position can be attributed to the net pension
liability, and there is a strong likelihood this will decline in coming years. As a result of greater retirement
contributions than normal costs, the District’s PERA division is 87.03% funded compared to the PERA
School division of 64.74% as of December 31, 2023. According to the annual financial report published by
PERA, the DPS Division is forecasted to eliminate the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities in six years.
Long-term liabilities decreased to $3,652.1 million from $3,738.8 million in FY 2023 primarily due to debt
service on Bonds and Certificates of Participation payable partially offset with an increase in net pension
liability.
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $1,567.7 million or 75% of total revenues
and program revenues were $518.0 million or 25% of the total revenues of the primary government. The
total revenues increased to $2,085.6 million from $1,913.3 million, or 9.0% when compared to prior year.
The change in net position of $204.0 million is partially due to an increase in property tax revenue of
$170 million, an increase in program revenues of $39.3 million, state share revenue decrease of $47.9
million and an increase of $127.7 million in total expenses compared to last year. The 9% increase is
primarily driven by the inflationary increase to the Total Program funding provided by the state of
Colorado.
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide
financial statements, 2) fund financial statements and 3) notes to the basic financial statements. This
report also contains required supplementary information and other supplementary information.
Government-wide Statements
The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with information about the
District as a whole using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector businesses.
The statement of net position includes District assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and
deferred inflows of resources, with differences reported as net position to the exclusion of fiduciary funds.
The statement of activities presents information on how the District’s net position changed during the
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported when the underlying event giving rise to the change
occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in
this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected
taxes and retiree sick leave payable).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
In the government-wide financial statements the District’s activities are shown as:
Governmental activities: Most of the District’s basic services are included here, such as instruction,
transportation, operations and maintenance and administration. Taxes and state funding principally
support these activities. The government-wide financial statements encompass not only the District itself
(the primary government) but also legally-separate entities including the ProComp Special Revenue Fund,
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation and Private Purpose Trust as blended component units and
Denver Public Schools Foundation and charter schools as discretely presented component units.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts used to maintain control over resources that have been
segregated for specific activities or objectives. The fund financial statements provide more detailed
information about the District’s operations, focusing on its most significant or major funds, not the District
as a whole. The District has two types of funds: governmental funds and fiduciary funds.
Governmental funds: Most of the District’s services are included in governmental funds, which
generally focus on how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flows and
the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds
statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine the status of financial resources that
can be spent in the near future to finance the District’s programs.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. Thus,
readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.
Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to the government-wide financial
statements in order to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental
activities. The District maintains nine individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately
in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances for the General, Grants Special Revenue, Bond Redemption
(debt service), and Building, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data for the other five
governmental funds (Pupil Activity Special Revenue, Food Services Special Revenue, ProComp Special
Revenue, Mill Levy Technology Maintenance and Permanent) are combined into a single, aggregated
presentation. Individual fund data for each of these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the form
of combining statements included in this report.
Fiduciary fund: The District has one Fiduciary fund which includes the Private Purpose Trust Fund. The
Fiduciary fund is used to account for resources held by the District in a fiduciary capacity and can only be
used for specified purposes. The Fiduciary fund is not reflected in the government-wide financial
statement because the resources of this fund are not available to support the District’s programs.
Notes to the basic financial statements: The notes provide additional information essential to a full
understanding of the data provided in the financial statements.
Other information: In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report
presents required supplementary information and other supplementary information. The required
supplemental information includes the District’s annual appropriated budgets with comparison schedules
that demonstrate compliance with budgets for the General Fund and Special Revenue Funds. The
schedule of changes in the collective net pension liability and OPEB liability are provided next, followed by

notes to required supplementary information. The other supplementary information includes the
combining statements in connection with nonmajor governmental funds and budgetary comparison
schedules. In addition, fiduciary fund information is presented.
Financial Analysis of the District
Increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of the District’s overall financial
position. The District's net position increased $204.0 million primarily due to continued revenue growth
and prudent management of expenses. Additionally, there are several other measures that indicate a
sustainable financial position, including:
 The District has the largest and most diverse tax base in the State of Colorado with $25.2 billion
of net assessed value.
 Continued growth of general fund balance including an increase of $21.7 million in FY 2024, with
ending fund balance of $169.4 million.
 Building fund balance of $459.5 million including remaining funds from the 2020 bond and other
capital reserves. Of the total remaining fund balance $144.3 million belongs to capital reserve.
A significant portion of the District’s assets are its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings,
equipment, lease of tangible assets and software-based information technology arrangement assets). The
District uses these assets to provide instruction and related services to its students. Capital, lease and
software assets (net) increased to $1,936.6 million in FY 2024 from $1,762.3 million in FY 2023. The
increase is primarily a result of capital spending from the District’s general obligation bonds and
certificates of participation. The District’s capital assets will continue to increase as planned projects are
completed in the Building Fund. Though the district's assets are mostly land and buildings, the value of
those assets for the purposes of this calculation are not "market rate" or the value if the properties were
to be acquired on the open market. They are valued based on the original purchase price plus
improvements and depreciation. In that way, the realistic value of the asset of the district should not be
compared to a non-government valuation.

Current and other assets decreased to $1,216.2 million from $1,346.2 million primarily due to the
continued spend of general obligation bonds and certificates of participation proceeds.

To calculate net investment in capital assets, the original long-term debt was evaluated to ascertain the
amount of proceeds spent on capital improvement versus non-capital expenditures. The percentage was
then applied to the outstanding long-term debt to determine the amount applicable to capital assets.

Most revenues to Colorado's school districts are provided through the Public School Finance Act of 1994
(as amended). The District’s adjusted total program funding for FY 2024 was $931.5 million reflected as a
combination of state equalization and a portion of property tax revenues in the Statement of Activities.
This was based on a funded pupil count of 84,848 and per pupil total program funding of $10,979
compared to total program funding of $886.1 million funded pupil count of 89,176 and per pupil total
program funding of $9,936 in FY 2023. Of the adjusted total program funding, $216.2 million was funded
through state share compared to $264.1 million in FY 2023. The remainder was funded through a
combination of local property and specific ownership taxes. The decline in state share from the previous
year is one of the ways the increases in property values and the resulting real property tax increases has
supported the state of Colorado's budget in the past year.
The District generated $1,246.8 million in property tax revenues in FY 2024 compared to $1,076.8 million
in FY 2023. Total property tax revenues include School Finance Act mills, override election mills, Tax
Abatement mills and Bond Redemption Fund mills. Property tax revenues increased by $170.0 million and
are attributable to the rising property valuations in the City and County of Denver. The District also
recognized a decrease in state equalization of $(47.9) million. District grants operating revenue increased
by $35.9 million year over year due to the second and third phase of Elementary and Secondary School
Emergency Relief Fund. Total expenses for the primary government in FY 2024 were $1,881.6 million
compared to $1,753.9 million in FY 2023. Total expenses increased by $127.7 million primarily due to
increased funding of instruction and student support services programs. Most of this increase was for
salary and benefits for the District's employees.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
Assigned fund balance includes $2.6 million budgeted for subsequent year expenditure and $13.0 million
for special projects.
The Grant Special Revenue Fund balance as of June 30, 2024 was $28.5 million compared to $22.1 million
at June 30, 2023. The fund balance is restricted to the District’s grant funded programs that generated
the fund balance.
The Bond Redemption Fund balance as of June 30, 2024 was $274.2 million compared to $226.6 million
as of June 30, 2023. The Bond Redemption Fund is restricted for payment of the District’s General
Obligation Bond debt service as authorized by Denver voters. The Bond Redemption Fund increased by
$47.6 million due to timing of upcoming debt service payments. The Bond Redemption Fund maintains a
fund balance in anticipation of principal and interest payments in December of the subsequent year
because property tax collections are not collected until after January 2025.
The Building Fund as of June 30, 2024 was $459.4 million compared to $682.8 million as of June 30,
2023. The Building Fund consists of unspent proceeds from issuance of voter approved general obligation
bonds and is restricted for financing projects as described in the respective ballot language. The Building
Fund also consists of unspent Certificates of Participation (COPs) restricted for financing capital projects
and for debt service. Additionally, a portion of these funds is restricted for capital projects by Board
authorization and assigned to debt service by Board adoption of the annual budget. The Building Fund
decreased by $223.4 million primarily as a result of continuing to spend down the 2020 general obligation
bond and COPs proceeds.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
In accordance with state law, the District’s budget is prepared on a GAAP basis. The most significant
budgeted fund is the General Fund.
The difference between the General Fund original and final budget for expenditures, excluding reserves,
increased by $51.5 million due to additional allocation of funds to schools and school support services.
The actual change to fund balance for the general fund was a $21.7 million increase. The main factor
driving the increase compared to the final budgeted revenue amount is in receiving $15.5 million in
additional total revenues.
Capital and Lease/Software Assets and Debt Administration
Capital and Lease/Software Assets
The District’s investment in capital assets and lease/software assets, net of accumulated depreciation for
its governmental activities as of June 30, 2024 amounted to $1,936.6 million. Investment in capital assets
includes land, buildings and improvements, equipment, right to use lease tangible assets and
software-based information technology (SBITA) intangible assets, and construction in progress with an
original cost greater than or equal to $25,000 and an estimated useful life longer than one year.
The major capital event during the current fiscal year within the Building Fund included the completion of
the new Montbello Campus. Capital projects are used to make improvements and critical repairs. In fiscal
year 2023, the District implemented GASB 96 (Statement No. 96) software-based information technology
arrangements reporting requirements for all state and local governments where the District is named the
lessee of intangible assets. The District recognized a SBITA liability within the government-wide financial
statements.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting as is the fiduciary fund financial statements. Revenues are
recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of
related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the fiscal year for which they are levied.
Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the
provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the District’s governmental activities and component
units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the
various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the
District considers grant and state revenues to be available if they are collected within 180 days of the
fiscal year-end. Property tax and other revenues are considered available if collected within 60 days of the
year-end. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting.
However, debt service expenditures as well as expenditures related to compensated absences, pension
and OPEB are recorded only when payment is due.
The District’s fiduciary funds apply the accrual basis of accounting and the economic resources
measurement focus.
The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing
accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, fund equity, revenue and
expenditures or expenses as appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in
individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which
spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are needed.
Governmental Funds
The District reports the following major governmental funds:
The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial
resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as detailed below. Primary revenue
sources for the general fund include property taxes, state equalization, tuition billing for early childhood
education and revenue and expenditures of sponsoring athletic events at District middle and high schools
starting fiscal year 2024.
The Grants Special Revenue Fund is used for the revenues and expenditures related to federal, state, and
local grants. Special Revenue funds are used to account for proceeds of special revenue sources that are

legally or otherwise restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. Revenue restrictions in this fund are
imposed by the grantor for the specific purposes of the grant.
The Bond Redemption Fund (debt service fund) accounts for and reports financial resources that are
restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-term general obligation debt of the District as
a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
The Building Fund is a capital projects fund and accounts for ongoing capital outlay needs of the District
such as construction, renovation projects, repairs and maintenance funded by the sale of general
obligation bonds, proceeds from the issuance of certificates of participation (COPs), other external
revenue sources and interfund transfers. Debt payments on certain COPs are also accounted for here.
The District reports the following nonmajor governmental funds:
The Food Services Special Revenue Fund accounts for the revenue and expenses related to providing
students with healthy and nutritious meals. Revenue sources for this fund include federal and state grants
and private sources.
The Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fundrepresents school sponsored student activities managed at the
school level.
The Mill Levy Technology Maintenance Special Revenue Fundaccounts for the proceeds of voter approved
taxes from the 2020 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are dedicated to maintenance
operations and technology improvements.
The ProComp Special Revenue Fund is a blended component unit used to account for the proceeds of
voter approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are the
professional compensation system of the teachers.
The Permanent Fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent that
only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the District’s programs.
Fiduciary Funds
The District has a Fiduciary Fund which is Private Purpose Trust Fund. The Private Purpose Trust Fund is
used to report all fiduciary activities that are not required to be reported in pension and other employee
benefit trust funds or investment trust funds and are held in trust
Budgets and Budgetary Accounting
The District adopts an annual budget for all funds, following these procedures in establishing the
budgetary data reflected in the accompanying financial statements:

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
Compensated Absences
The compensated absence liability including payroll taxes, reported on the government-wide financial
statements consists of accumulated sick and vacation leave which vests and is payable upon termination
or retirement. Accumulated sick leave vests only at qualified retirement and vests as a rate determined by
contract, which is less than the normal rate of pay. A qualified retiree can be paid for up to one
work-years' worth of accumulated sick leave. Retirees who accumulate vacation leave are compensated
at their normal rate of pay for the balance at retirement. On the fund financial statements, compensated
absence amounts are reported as expenditures or expenses, as appropriate, when paid.
Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are
reported as liabilities. Debt premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the debt
using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The appropriate
obligations are reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and discounts during
the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums
received on debt issuance are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuance are
reported as other financing uses. In accordance with Section 22-45-103, CRS, the District’s bond
redemption fund custodian for FY 2024 was U.S. Bank.
Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities, GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement
No. 27 , GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits other
than Pensions and GASB Statement No. 87 Leases the government-wide statements include deferred
outflows of resources representing the deferred loss on refunding of the District’s certificates of
participation and bond obligations and items relating to the District’s pension and OPEB obligations.
Deferred inflows of resources relate to deferred gain on refunding, pension, OPEB obligations and leases.
Additionally, the governmental fund financial statements include deferred inflows of resources for
property taxes receivable and long-term receivables that have not met modified accrual revenue
recognition criteria.
Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets, restricted
and unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes amounts for debt service,
performance-based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education, non-governmental
grantor-designated purposes, and capital projects.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy based
primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for
which amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances, the District considers
amounts to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for which fund balance is both
available and can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54, the fund balances of the District are
classified into the following categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.

2. CASH AND INVESTMENTS
Investments Authorized by the Colorado Statutes and District’s Investment Policy
The table below identifies the investment types that are authorized by the District’s investment policy or
Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS), where more restrictive. The table also identifies certain provisions of the
District’s investment policy that address interest rate risk, credit risk and concentration of credit risk. The
table does not address the investments of (a) debt proceeds that are governed by the provisions of the debt
agreements of the District, or (b) Special Revenue ProComp Trust assets that are governed by the Trust’s
Investment Policy Statement rather than the general provisions of the District’s investment policy.

Guaranteed Investment Contracts C.R.S. 24-75-601 N/A N/A
*Other than repurchase agreements for investment of general obligation bond proceeds and certificates of
deposit.
As of June 30, 2024, the District investments are in compliance with the investment policy.
Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements
The District invests in various investment securities that are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is possible that changes in the
values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such change could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.
The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally
accepted accounting principles. The valuation is based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the
asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are inputs other
than those within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 inputs are significant
unobservable inputs.
61

--- PAGE 62 ---

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
The District has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2024:
 Corporate Notes of $22,240,872 are valued using quoted market price or other observable inputs
(Level 1 and 2 inputs).
 U.S. Treasury securities of $181,317,419 are valued using quoted price in active markets for
identical assets (Level 1 and 2 inputs).
 Repurchase Agreements of $42,275,000 are valued using pricing models (Level 2 inputs).
Custodial Credit Risk
Colorado law requires the District to use eligible public depositories as defined by the Public Deposit
Protection Act of 1989 (the Act). Under the Act, the depository is required to pledge eligible collateral having
a market value at all times equal to 102% of the aggregate public depositories not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Eligible collateral as defined by the Act primarily includes obligations of, or
guarantees by, the U.S. government, the State of Colorado or any political subdivision thereof and
obligations evidenced by notes secured by first lien mortgages of trust on real property.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District will not be able to recover its
deposits nor the collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.
The District’s deposits are with eligible public depositories and are considered to be held in the name of the
District. These deposits have bank balances of $18,426,748 and related carrying amount of $11,435,308.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest rates. The
District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the Colorado Revised
Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing a combination of shorter and
longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is either
maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed by operations and
debt service requirements.
The following table shows the distribution of the District’s cash and cash equivalents and investments by
maturity, which displays the sensitivity of the fair values of the District’s investments, including investments
held by bond trustee, to market rate fluctuations:
Maturity

Total certificates of participation $ 870,006,070
In prior years, the registered voters of Denver authorized the School District to issue general obligation
bonds. As of June 30, 2024, all previously authorized bonds had been issued.
On May 1, 2013, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $58.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013C. The certificates provided funding of various projects in the Central Park Urban
Redevelopment Area including the acquisition, improvement, and placement in service of one additional
District elementary and K-8 schools. Also included were various improvements to the high school and
sports field. The District and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority have entered into a 2013 Supplemental
Denver Public Schools Funding Agreement to provide reimbursement to the District for the above listed
projects which will serve as the source of repayment for the Series 2013C Certificates of Participation.
In September of 2015, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $8.6 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2015B. The proceeds were used for the purchase of the parking garage located at
1855 Lincoln Street in downtown Denver and the land upon which it is located. The primary purpose is to
provide affordable and long-term parking for the users of the Emily Griffith Campus. The Certificates
explain undivided interests in the right to receive certain revenues payable by the District under an
annually renewed Lease Purchase Agreement dated on October 5, 2015.
In May of 2017, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $32 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2017A and $14 million of Certificates of Participation, Series 2017B. The purpose of
the 2017A issuance was to construct the Central Park Street School, an elementary school located in the
Central Park neighborhood of Denver. The proceeds from 2017B issuance were used to purchase a school
site for the Central Park Street School and to help fund the design and construction cost of a fire station
near the school site to meet safety standards for DPS schools within Central Park.
In November of 2017, as authorized by the Board resolution, the District issued $10 million Refunding
Certificate of Participation, Series 2017C. The proceeds for the issuance in combination with the proceeds
received from the sale of Emily Griffith Opportunity School properties were used for the refunding of
$35.2 million of 2013A Certificate of Participation.
In February of 2018, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $7.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2018. The proceeds were used to purchase a building located at 1617 South Acoma
Street in Denver and the site upon which it is located. The Acoma building currently houses 150 District
employees in the Planning, Design and Construction, Library Services, JROTC, Extended Learning and
Community Schools departments.

adjustments resulting from the 2018 and 2020 AAP assessments. Employer contributions also
include current and estimated future AED and SAED, until the actuarial value funding ratio
reaches 103%, at which point the AED and SAED will each drop 0.50% every year until they are
zero. Additionally, estimated employer contributions reflect reductions for the funding of the AIR
and retiree health care benefits. For future plan members, employer contributions were further
reduced by the estimated amount of total service costs for future plan members not financed by
their member contributions.
 Employer contributions for the DPS Division are reduced by an amount equal to the principal
payments plus interest necessary each year to finance the pension certificates of participation
(PCOPs) issued in 1997 and 2008 and refinanced thereafter.
 As specified in law, the State, as a nonemployer contributing entity, will provide an annual direct
distribution of $225 million (actual dollars), commencing July 1, 2018, that is proportioned
between the State, School, Judicial, and DPS Division Trust Funds based upon the covered payroll
of each Division. The annual direct distribution ceases when all Division Trust Funds are fully
funded.
 Employer contributions and the amount of total service costs for future plan members were based
upon a process to estimate future actuarially determined contributions assuming an analogous
future plan member growth rate.
 The AIR balance was excluded from the initial FNP, as, per statute, AIR amounts cannot be used
to pay benefits until transferred to either the retirement benefits reserve or the survivor benefits
reserve, as appropriate. AIR transfers to the FNP and the subsequent AIR benefit payments were
estimated and included in the projections.
 Benefit payments and contributions were assumed to be made at the middle of the year.
 Beginning with December 31, 2023, measurement date and thereafter, the FNP as of the current
measurement date is used as a starting point for the GASB 67 projection test.
Based on the above assumptions and methods, the DPS Division’s FNP was projected to be available to
make all projected future benefit payments of current members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate
of return of 7.25 percent on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit
payments to determine the TPL. The discount rate determination does not use the municipal bond index
rate, and therefore, the discount rate is 7.25 percent. There was no change in the discount rate from
the prior measurement date.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The District is a party to pending or potential lawsuits under which it may be required to pay certain
amounts upon final disposition of these matters. After consulting with counsel, the District’s management
has concluded that no significant adverse effect on the June 30, 2024 financial statements should result
upon final disposition of these proceedings.
The District has a potential liability relating to the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act),
which is a federally-funded hazardous material/asbestos management program administered by the State
Health Department. It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with the Act, therefore no liability
has been accrued. It is expected that these expenditures will not have a significant impact on the
financial position of the District.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be questioned
as not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to
reimbursement to the grantor agencies. The District's management believes a disallowance, if any, will be
immaterial.
For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District reported a deficit net position of $357,460,883 in the
government-wide statements. This deficit can be primarily attributed to the implementation of GASB 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27
requiring the recognition of a long-term liability for pensions. The deficit net position can also be
attributed to liabilities related to the District’s Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds to
fund retirement and necessary capital and maintenance projects of the District’s facilities.
Encumbrances represent a contractual obligation and expenditures are recognized when the goods and
services are delivered and/or received. As of June 30, 2024 encumbrances for the governmental funds
were:
Fund Encumbrances
General 14,925,747
Grant Special Revenue Fund 2,784,666
Building Fund 40,084,522
Nonmajor Funds 1,959,207
Total $ 59,754,142
General Fund encumbrances include utilities, commitments to the District’s health care plans as well as
districtwide and school level operations.
Grant Special Revenue Fund comprises commitments for literacy professional services, summer school
tuition assistance and student technology devices.
Building Fund encumbrances include commitments towards major capital maintenance and construction
projects such as but not limited to construction of the future phases of Montbello and Ceylon campus,
DSA South Remodel, John F. Kennedy electrical upgrades and Loretto Heights soccer field. Other major
commitments for heating ventilation and cooling projects at Thomas Jefferson, Stedman, Columbine and
Sabin. Also included are commitments towards the District Wide Long Term Safety Plan, District Wide
Student My Tech and Enterprise Management.
Nonmajor Fund encumbrances include commitments for food services and athletics equipment.

14. CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS
At the general election held November 1992, voters approved the TABOR amendment to the Colorado
Constitution limiting the ability of the state and local governments such as the District to increase
revenues, debt and spending and restricting property, income and other taxes. In November 1999 the
Denver voters gave the District approval to exceed the spending limits established in TABOR beginning
with the 1999 fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the state and local governments obtain voter
approval to create any "multiple fiscal year direct or indirect debt or other financial obligation whatsoever
without adequate present cash reserves pledged irrevocably and held for payments in all future fiscal
years.” The amendment exempts from its restrictions the borrowings and fiscal operations of enterprises.
Enterprises are defined to include government owned businesses authorized to issue their own revenue
bonds and receiving under 10% of their grants from all state and local government sources combined.
The amendment also requires the establishment of an emergency reserve equal to three percent of fiscal
year spending excluding debt service.
In accordance with TABOR, the District maintains an emergency reserve of 3% of fiscal year spending by
designating real property owned by the District in lieu of cash. For fiscal year 2024, spending was
$1,550,870,445 and the 3% emergency reserve was $46,526,113, which excludes multi-year obligations
of $359,868. Additionally, in accordance with C.R.S. Section 22-44-105, the District established an
emergency cash reserve as a restricted fund balance in the General Fund for $40,707,510 equal to 3% of
budgeted General Fund revenues. The remaining $5.8 million of the emergency reserve is secured by
physical property.

15. COMPONENT UNITS
The District has 24 component units consisting of 2 blended component units and 22 discretely presented
component units. Charter schools are included in the component units as they are fiscally dependent upon
revenues derived from the State per pupil revenue funding calculation.
Change in Reporting Entity
The component units combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity. The changes in
reporting entity include charter schools that closed.
As of June 30, 2024, American Indian Academy was closed due to financials and declining enrollment.
American Indian's School board of directors voted to close the school at the end of the 2022-2023 school
year and terminate its charter contract with its authorizer.
Blended Component Units
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c) (3) and
501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings and equipment
for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for the creation and
continued management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is ultimately responsible for
any deficits or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation issued by the DSFLC and its activities
for the year are reflected in the accompanying government-wide financial statements of the District. An
evaluation of the DSFLC using the above considerations results in its blended inclusion in the
accompanying financial statements. There are no separate financial statements available for the DSFLC
and the financial information of the DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government which is why
DSFLC is not shown on the schedules in this note.
Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System for Teachers
The Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System (ProComp) was established following the
approval of the 2005 Mill Levy Override as a groundbreaking compensation system that links teacher pay
to the instructional mission of the District. Designed in a partnership between the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association (DCTA) and the District, ProComp has received national attention because it rewards
teachers for their professional accomplishments while linking pay to student achievement. The financial
information of ProComp is blended with that of the primary government, which is why ProComp is not
shown on the schedules in this note. ProComp is presented as a component unit because it is a separate
legal entity and is financially accountable to the District.

District in the form of grants, scholarships and special projects which support innovative classroom
initiatives and enhance the educational opportunities of District students and staff. In addition, donations

NOTES TO OTHER REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
1. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AFFECTING TRENDS IN ACTUARIAL INFORMATION - PENSIONS
2023 Changes in Plan Provisions and Assumptions or Other Inputs Since 2022
• Senate Bill (SB) 23-056, enacted and effective June 2, 2023, intended to recompense PERA for the
remaining portion of the $225 million direct distribution originally scheduled for receipt July 1, 2020,
suspended due to the enactment of House Bill (HB) 20-1379, but not fully repaid through the provisions
within HB 22-1029. Pursuant to SB 23-056, the State Treasurer issued a warrant consisting of the
balance of the PERA Payment Cash Fund, created in §24-51-416, plus $10 million from the General
Fund, totaling $14.561 million.
• As of the December 31, 2023, measurement date, the total pension liability (TPL) recognizes the
change in the default method applied for granting service accruals for certain members, from a
"12-pay" method to a "non-12-pay" method. The default service accrual method for positions with an
employment pattern of at least eight months but fewer than 12 months (including, but not limited to
positions in the School and DPS Divisions) receive a higher ratio of service credit for each month
worked, up to a maximum of 12 months of service credit per year.
• Actual employer contributions to the DPS Division are reduced by an amount equal to the principal
payments plus interest necessary each year to finance the pension certificates of participation (PCOPs)
issued in 1997 and 2008 and refinanced thereafter.
2022 Changes in Plan Provisions and Assumptions or Other Inputs Since 2021
 Price inflation assumption decreased from 2.40% per year to 2.30% per year
 Real rate of investment return assumption remained at 7.25% per year, net of investment expenses
 Wage inflation assumption decreased from 3.50% per year to 3.00% per year
 Real wage growth decreased from 1.10% to 0.70%
 House Bill (HB) 22-1029, effective upon enactment in 2022, required the State treasurer to issue, in addition
to the regularly scheduled $225 million (actual dollars) direct distribution, a warrant to PERA in the amount
of $380 million (actual dollars) with reductions to future direct distributions. The July 1, 2023, direct
distribution will be reduced by $190 million (actual dollars) to $35 million (actual dollars). The July 1, 2024,
direct distribution will not be reduced from $225 million (actual dollars) due to a negative investment
return in 2022.
 Actual employer contributions to the DPS Division are reduced by an amount equal to the principal payments
plus interest necessary each year to finance the pension certificates of participation (PCOPs) issued in 1997
and 2008 and refinanced thereafter
2021 Changes in Plan Provisions and Assumptions or Other Inputs Since 2020
 The assumption used to value the automatic increase cap benefit provision was changed from 1.25 percent
to 1.00 percent
 Actual employer contributions to the DPS Division are reduced by an amount equal to the principal payments
plus interest necessary each year to finance the pension certificates of participation (PCOPs) issued in 1997
and 2008 and refinanced thereafter
