MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado
(the “District”), provides readers of the District’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(CAFR) this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We encourage readers to consider the information
presented here in conjunction with additional information that is presented in the letter of
transmittal, which starts on page ten of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the Statement of Net Position, as of June 30, 2016, the District’s net position for
governmental activities is a deficit of $1.26 billion. The deficit net position is primarily the
result of two factors. The first is the result of the District executing Certificates of
Participation to fund the District’s pension plan known as Denver Public Schools Retirement
System (DPSRS) prior to its merger as a separate division within the state’s Public Employees
Retirement Association (PERA). In July of 1997, the District executed $384.2 million in
Certificates of Participation with the net proceeds contributed to DPSRS. In April of 2008,
the District issued $750 million in Certificates of Participation to refund existing certificates
and to fund an additional $397.8 million contribution to DPSRS in anticipation of the merger
with PERA. As a result of these contributions, the District’s PERA division is 79.3% funded
compared to the PERA School division of 60.4% as of December 31, 2015. Second, in order
to fund the District’s capital program, the voters of Denver authorized General Obligation
bonds in November 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2012 of $305 million, $310.8 million, $454 million,
and $466 million respectively. The proceeds of these bonds were used to fund necessary
capital and maintenance of the District’s facilities.
Long-term liabilities increased to $3,232.4 million from $3,120.4 million in FY 2015 primarily
due to an increase in pension liability.
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $1,024.7 million or 79% of
total revenues, and program revenues were $269.9 million or 21% of the total revenues of
the primary government. The total revenues increased from $1,196.6 to $1,294.6, or 8%
when compared to prior year, primarily due to increased property taxes and specific
ownership taxes.
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s
basic financial statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1)
government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the
financial statements. This report also contains required supplementary information and other
supplementary information.
Government-wide Statements
The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with information
about the District as a whole using accounting methods similar to those used by private-
sector businesses.

Financial Analysis of the District
A significant portion of the District’s assets are its investment in capital assets (e.g., land,
buildings, and equipment). The District uses these assets to provide instruction and related
services to its students. Capital assets (net) increased from $1.10 billion in 2015 to $1.17
billion in 2016. The increase is primarily a result of capital spending from the District’s general
obligation bonds and certificates of participation. The District’s capital assets will continue
to increase as planned projects are completed in the Capital Reserve and Building Fund.
Combined, these funds have available fund balance of $104.5 million.
Current and other assets decreased from $714.7 million to $596.8 million primarily due to
the spending of the proceeds from general obligation bonds and certificates of participation
as described in the capital improvement plan in the letter of transmittal.
The following table provides a summary of the District’s net position as of June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively (in millions):

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
To calculate net investment in capital assets, the original long-term debt was evaluated to
ascertain the amount of proceeds not spent, and of the amount spent, what portion of it had
been used on capital assets versus maintenance projects and other non-capital expenditures.
That percentage was then applied to the outstanding long-term debt to determine the
amount applicable to capital assets.
The following table provides a summary of the District’s activities for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (in millions):

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
Financial Analysis of the District’s Funds
The District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related
legal requirements.
Governmental funds
The focus of the District’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows,
outflows, and balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the
District’s financing requirements. In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as a
useful measure of the District’s net resources available for spending.
Fund balance of all governmental funds decreased by $112.6 million. The General Fund is
the primary operating fund of the District. Fund balance of the General Fund at June 30,
2016 was $94.5 million, compared to $106.5 million as of June 30, 2015. This decrease is a
planned spend down of reserves in order to limit the effects of decreases in state funding
levels from the 2009-10 school year. The Building Fund and Capital Reserve Funds decreased
by $115.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively, as a result of planned capital spending. They
are offset by an increase in the Bond Redemption fund of $30.5 million due to timing of
upcoming debt service payments. Fund balance of the ProComp Special Revenue Fund
decreased by $13.0 million due to planned increases in program spending. The Food Services
Fund balance increased $141 thousand year over year.
Proprietary funds
The District’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the
government-wide financial statements, but in more detail. The fund statements show the
Internal Service Fund, the District’s only proprietary fund, which is included with the
governmental activities for the government-wide financial statements.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
In accordance with state law, the District’s budget is prepared on a GAAP basis except for
the General, Capital Reserve, and Building funds, which are budgeted on the budgetary basis
and adjusts for salary accruals and encumbrances. The most significant budgeted fund is
the General Fund.
The difference between the General Fund original and final budget for expenditures was an
overall increase of $12.89 million and is due to higher forecasted expenses, shifting certain
funds from Government Designated Purpose Grant Fund, a lower beginning balance and a
shift from Unappropriated Reserves to Appropriated Reserves.
The major difference between the District’s final budget and actual expenditures relates to
budgeted reserves that were not spent.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
Separate financial statements are provided for major governmental funds, proprietary funds, and
fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial
statements. Major governmental funds (General Fund, Grants Special Revenue, Food Services
Special Revenue, ProComp Special Revenue, Bond Redemption, Building and Capital Reserve) are
reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements.
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary
fund financial statements. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when
a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized
as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as
revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the district’s governmental activities and
component units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program
revenues reported for the various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as
soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when
they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the
current period. For this purpose, the district considers grant revenues to be available if they are
collected within 180 days of the fiscal year-end. Property tax and other revenues are considered
available if collected within 60 days of the year-end. Expenditures generally are recorded when
a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However debt service expenditures as well as
expenditures related to compensated absences are recorded only when payment is due.
The District’s agency funds apply the accrual basis of accounting, but do not have a measurement
focus.
The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a
separate accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set
of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenue and
expenditures or expenses as appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted
for in individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by
which spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use,
it is the District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are
needed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
The district reports the following major governmental funds:
General Fund - The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to
account for all financial resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as
detailed below. Primary revenue sources for the general fund include property taxes and state
equalization.
Grants Special Revenue Fund – This fund is used to account for the proceeds of specific
revenue sources that are restricted to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service
or capital projects. Both the federal, state and local grants fund and the foundation and private
grants fund account for revenue and expenses specifically related to grants which have various
restrictions based on the specific grant.
Food Services Special Revenue Fund – This fund accounts for the revenue and expenses
related to providing breakfast, lunch and snacks to district students and employees. Revenue
sources for this fund include federal and state grants and private sources.
ProComp Special Revenue Fund – This special revenue fund is used to account for the
proceeds of voter-approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. The investments and
expenditures are for the professional compensation system for teachers.
Bond Redemption Fund - The Bond Redemption Fund (debt service fund) accounts for and
reports financial resources that are restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-
term general obligation debt of the district as a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
Building Fund – This fund is used to account for and report bond funded financial resources
that are restricted to expenditure of capital outlays, including the acquisition or construction of
capital facilities and other capital assets.
Capital Reserve Fund – This fund is used to accumulate non-bond funded resources, for the
acquisition, renovation and maintenance of capital assets.
The other governmental funds of the district account for resources where use is restricted to a
particular purpose and include the Pupil Activity Fund and the Permanent Fund.
Pupil Activity Fund – This fund accounts for the revenue and expenditures of sponsoring
athletic events at district middle and high schools.
Tuition Special Revenue Fund – This fund accounts for revenues and expenses for providing
early childhood education and full day kindergarten. Revenues are primarily derived from tuition
billings.
Permanent Fund – This fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to
the extent that only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the district’s
programs.

Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types in the fund financial
statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the
applicable governmental activities or proprietary fund type statement of net position. Debt
premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-
line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The appropriate obligations are
reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and
discounts during the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing
sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while
discounts on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. In accordance with Section
22-45-103, CRS, the District’s bond redemption fund custodian for fiscal year 2015-2016 was
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., third party.
Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities,
and GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment
of GASB Statement No. 27, the government-wide statements include deferred outflows of
resources representing the deferred loss on refundings of the district’s certificates of participation
and bond obligations and items relating to the District’s pension obligations and deferred inflows
of resources relating to pension obligations. Additionally, the governmental fund financial
statements include deferred inflows of resources for property taxes receivable and long-term
receivables that have not met modified accrual revenue recognition criteria.
Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets,
restricted and unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes restricted amounts for
debt service, performance-based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education,
non-governmental grantor-designated purposes, state and federal programs, permanent fund,
capital projects, and donor-designated purposes.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy
based primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific
purposes for which amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances,
the District considers amounts to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for
which fund balance is both available and can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54,
the fund balances of the District are classified into the following categories: nonspendable,
restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.

Investments Authorized by the Colorado Statutes and District’s Investment Policy
The table below identifies the investment types that are authorized by the District’s investment
policy or Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS), where more restrictive. The table also identifies
certain provisions of the District’s investment policy that address interest rate risk, credit risk and
concentration of credit risk. The table does not address the investments of (a) debt proceeds
that are governed by the provisions of the debt agreements of the District, or (b) Special Revenue
ProComp Trust assets that are governed by the Trust’s Investment Policy Statement rather than
the general provisions of the District’s investment policy.

Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements
The District has entered into a forward delivery agreement with US Bank with a maturity date of
December 2023 and a forward delivery agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank with a maturity
date of December 2018. The provisions of the contracts and not the District’s investment policy
govern the forward delivery investments. Under the terms of the contracts, the District recorded
interest received in advance as unearned revenue in the General Fund.
As of August 9, 2006 when HB 1287 was signed, investments held in the ProComp Special
Revenue Fund and administered by the ProComp Trust are exempt from the investment
restrictions placed on local governments. Consequently the trust’s board of directors adopted an
investment policy statement which authorizes domestic and international equity securities, fixed
income securities, and alternative investments including hedging strategies.
The district invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various
risks such as interest rate, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain
investment securities, it is possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest
rates. The District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the
Colorado Revised Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing
a combination of shorter and longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities
so that a portion of the portfolio is either maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide
the cash flow and liquidity needed by operations and debt service requirements.
The following table shows the distribution of the District’s cash and cash equivalents and
investments by maturity, which displays the sensitivity of the fair values of the District’s
investments, including investments held by bond trustee, to market rate fluctuations:

On November 3, 1998, November 4, 2003, November 4, 2008 and November 6, 2012 the
registered voters of Denver authorized the School District to issue $305 million, $310.8 million,
$454 million, and $466 million respectively, of general obligation bonds. As of June 30, 2016,
all previously authorized bonds had been issued.
The Certificates of Participation series 1997 were executed to fund Denver Public Schools
Retirement System (DPSRS) pension plan Unfunded Accrued Actuarial Liability (UAAL).
On January 31, 2013, as authorized by Board resolution, the District entered into Lease Purchase
Financing Series 2013 for a principal amount of $35.2 million. These funds along with funding
from the 2012 General Obligation bonds were used to purchase and refurbish the District’s
Downtown Campus located at 1860 Lincoln. The building houses the central administrative
functions of the District, the Emily Griffith Technical College (EGTC) and High School (EGHS)
programs, and the Downtown Denver Expeditionary School (DDES.) The downtown campus
creates financial benefits for the District and taxpayers through facility consolidation and sharing.
On May 1, 2013, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $58.7 million Certificates
of Participation, Series 2013C. The certificates provide funding of various projects in the Stapleton
Urban Redevelopment Area consisting of the acquisition, improvement, and placement in service
of one additional District elementary school and one additional K-8 school, and the acquisition
and construction, including site preparation, of various improvements related to a District high
school and sports field. The District and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority have entered into

taxes, on all of the taxable property in the District, sufficient to pay debt service on Bonds when
due. The Certificate of Participation are secured by schools and administrative properties owned
and operated by the District.

The Building Fund balance of $87,492,008 is from the issuance of Series 2009A, 2009C, 2010A,
2012B, 2012C and 2014A general obligation bonds and related interest earnings. At June 30,
2016, the School District had capital expenditure purchase commitments outstanding of
$38,807,013.
Defeasance of Certificates of Participation
In prior years, the District defeased certain Certificates of Participation by placing the proceeds
of the new certificates in an irrevocable trust to provide for all future payments on the old
obligations. Accordingly, the trust account assets and the liability for the defeased obligations
are not included in the District’s financial statements. At June 30, 2016, $7,518,310 of outstanding
certificates of participation are considered defeased.
Defeasance of General Obligation Bonds
On May 10, 2016 the District advance refunded a portion of the District’s Series 2012B general
obligation bonds with an average interest rate of 4.99% the proceeds from the issuance of Series
2016A general obligation bonds, with an average interest rate of 4.222%. The defeased bonds
are not considered a liability of the District since sufficient funds of $169,003,421 were deposited
with an escrow agent and invested in Federal Securities for the purpose of paying the principal
and interest when due. Total debt service on the 2016A refunding bonds will be $211,176,125
through December 2031 for a decrease of $7,894,875 from the debt service on the 2012B bonds
of $219,071,000 through December 2031. The refunding results in a present value saving to the
District and taxpayers of Denver of $7,562,484.
In prior years, the District advance refunded a portion of the District’s Series 2004A, 2004C and
2009A general obligation bonds with the proceeds from the issuance of new general obligation
bonds. The defeased bonds are not considered a liability of the District since sufficient funds
were deposited with an escrow agent and invested in government securities for the purpose of
paying the principal and interest when due. At June 30, 2016, $287,655,000 of refunded 2009A
and 2012B bonds are considered defeased.
Forward Delivery Agreements
In February 2003, the District entered into a forward delivery agreement whereby it received $9.8
million for the General Fund in exchange for the future earnings from the investment of future
general fund revenues that will be used to meet the debt service requirements for the 1997
taxable pension certificates of participation issue. Of this $9.8 million, $8,277,188 has been
recognized as revenue, with the remaining amount to be recognized as revenue over the
remaining life of the issue or through December 2018.

 Employer contributions and the amount of total service costs for future plan members
were based upon a process used by the plan to estimate future actuarially determined
contributions assuming an analogous future plan member growth rate.
 The AIR balance was excluded from the initial fiduciary net position, as, per statute, AIR
amounts cannot be used to pay benefits until transferred to either the retirement benefits
reserve or the survivor benefits reserve, as appropriate. As the ad hoc post-retirement
benefit increases financed by the AIR are defined to have a present value at the long-
term expected rate of return on plan investments equal to the amount transferred for
their future payment, AIR transfers to the fiduciary net position and the subsequent AIR
benefit payments have no impact on the Single Equivalent Interest Rate (SEIR)
determination process when the timing of AIR cash flows is not a factor (i.e., the plan’s
fiduciary net position is not projected to be depleted). When AIR cash flow timing is a
factor in the SEIR determination process (i.e., the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected
to be depleted), AIR transfers to the fiduciary net position and the subsequent AIR benefit
payments were estimated and included in the projections.
 Benefit payments and contributions were assumed to be made at the end of the month.
Based on the above actuarial cost method and assumptions, the DPS Division’s fiduciary net
position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current
members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was
applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The
discount rate determination does not use the Municipal Bond Index Rate. There was no change
in the discount rate from the prior measurement date.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The district is a party to numerous pending or threatened lawsuits under which it may be required
to pay certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. After consulting with counsel, the
district's management has concluded that no significant adverse effect on the June 30, 2016
financial statements should result upon final disposition of these proceedings. The district has a
potential liability relating to the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act), which is a
federally-funded hazardous material/asbestos management program administered by the State
Health Department. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of expenditures which
will be required to comply with the Act. It is expected that these expenditures will not have a
significant impact on the financial position of the district.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be
questioned as not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits
could lead to reimbursement to the grantor agencies. The district's management believes
disallowances, if any, will be immaterial.
For the year ended June 30, 2016, the district reported a deficit net position of $1,257,026,715
in the government-wide statements. This deficit can be partially attributed to the implementation
of GASB 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement
No. 27, requiring the recognition of a long-term liability for pensions. Also, liabilities related to
the district’s execution of Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds to fund
retirement and necessary capital and maintenance projects of the district’s facilities.
For the year ended June 30, 2016, the district incurred expenses in excess of appropriations in
the Bond Redemption Fund and Warehouse internal service Fund by $29.4 million and $11
thousand respectively, which may be a violation of state statute.

13. CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS
At the general election held November 3, 1992, voters approved an amendment (commonly
termed the Taxpayers Bill of Rights, or TABOR) to the Colorado Constitution limiting the ability
of the state and local governments such as the district to increase revenues, debt and
spending, and restricting property, income and other taxes. On November 2, 1999 the Denver
voters gave the district approval to exceed the spending limits established in TABOR beginning
with the 1999 fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the state and local governments
obtain voter approval to create any "multiple fiscal year direct or indirect debt or other financial
obligation whatsoever without adequate present cash reserves pledged irrevocably and held for
payments in all future fiscal years". The amendment exempts from its restrictions the
borrowings and fiscal operations of "enterprises". Enterprises are defined to include
government owned businesses authorized to issue their own revenue bonds and receiving
under 10% of their grants from all state and local government sources combined. The
amendment also requires the establishment of an "Emergency Reserve" equal to three percent
of fiscal year spending excluding debt service.
In accordance with TABOR, the district maintains an emergency reserve of 3% of fiscal year
spending by designating real property owned by the district in lieu of cash. For fiscal year
2016, fiscal year spending was $978,863,631, and the 3% emergency reserve was
$29,365,909, which excludes multi-year obligations of $167,005. Additionally, in accordance
with C.R.S. Section 22-44-105, the district established an emergency cash reserve as a
restricted fund balance in the general fund for $24,910,740 equal to 3% of budgeted general
fund revenues.

14. COMPONENT UNITS
The District has 39 component units consisting of one blended component unit and 38 discretely
presented component units.
Change in Reporting Entity and Prior Period Adjustments
The component unit combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity and prior
period adjustments. The changes in reporting entity include the addition of new charter schools
(footnoted as A in the combining statements), charter schools with expired charters that were
not renewed (footnoted as B in the combining statements) and changes in reporting entity for
charter school networks that were previously reported at the school level and are now reported
at the network level (see footnote C in the combining statements).
Blended Component Unit
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c)
(3) and 501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code, and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings
and equipment for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for
the creation and continued management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is
ultimately responsible for any deficits or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation
issued by the DSFLC and its activities for the year are reflected in the accompanying government-
wide financial statements of the District. An evaluation of the DSFLC using the above
considerations results in its blended inclusion in the accompanying financial statements. There
are no separate financial statements available for the DSFLC and the financial information of the
DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government which is why DSFLC is not shown on the
schedules in this note.
Discretely Presented Component Units
Denver Public Schools Foundation
In 1984 the Denver Public Schools Foundation (the “Foundation”) was incorporated as a widely
based not-for-profit charitable organization whose educational purposes are to support the
mission, goals and objectives of the District. Separately issued financial statements are available
from the Foundation at 1860 Lincoln St, Denver, CO 80203. Certain note disclosures for the
Foundation have been excerpted from the Foundations’ financial statements.
Charter Schools
In 1993, the State of Colorado Legislature enacted the “Charter School Act – Colorado Revised
Statutes (CRS) Section 22-30.5-101,” which permits the District to contract with individuals and
organizations for the operation of charter schools within the District. The charter schools are
financed by a portion of the District’s School Finance Act Revenues (based on student enrollment),
