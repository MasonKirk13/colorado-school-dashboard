The defeased\nbonds are not considered a liability of the District since sufficient funds were deposited with an escrow\nagent and invested in government securities for the purpose of paying the principal and interest when due.\nAt June 30, 2015, $149,170,000 of refunded 2009A bonds are considered defeased.\n76",
