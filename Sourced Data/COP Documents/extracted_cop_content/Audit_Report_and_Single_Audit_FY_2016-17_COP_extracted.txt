MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado (the
“District”), provides readers of the District’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2017. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional
information that is presented in the letter of transmittal, which starts on page ten of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the Statement of Net Position, as of June 30, 2017, the District’s net position for governmental activities
is a deficit of $1,357.1 million. The deficit net position is primarily the result of two factors. The first is the
result of the District executing Certificates of Participation (COP) to fund the District’s pension plan known
as Denver Public Schools Retirement System (DPSRS) prior to its merger as a separate division within the
state’s Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA). In July of 1997, the District executed $384.2
million in Certificates of Participation with the net proceeds contributed to DPSRS. In April of 2008, the
District issued $750 million in Certificates of Participation to refund existing certificates and to fund an
additional $397.8 million contribution to DPSRS in anticipation of the merger with PERA. As a result of
these contributions, the District’s PERA division is 74% funded compared to the PERA School division of
46% as of December 31, 2016. Second, in order to fund the District’s capital program, the voters of Denver
authorized General Obligation bonds in November 1998, 2003, 2008, 2012, and 2016 of $305 million,
$310.8 million, $454 million, $466 million and $572 million respectively. The proceeds of these bonds are
used to fund necessary capital and maintenance of the District’s facilities. (See additional details in Note 5
and Note 6 to the financial statements).
Long-term liabilities increased to $3,978.3 million from $3,232.4 million in FY 2016 primarily due to an
increase in pension liability along with the issuance of the 2017 bond proceeds (voter approved in 2016).
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $1,071.4 million or 79% of total revenues,
and program revenues were $278.1 million or 21% of the total revenues of the primary government. The
total revenues increased from $1,294.6 to $1,349.5, or 4% when compared to prior year, primarily due to
increased property taxes. Net position declined year over year primarily due to an increase in the net pension
liability as reflected in pension expense. (See additional details in Note 8 to the financial statements.)
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial
statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide financial
statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains
required supplementary information and other supplementary information.

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
Grants Special Revenue, Food Services Special Revenue, ProComp Special Revenue, Bond Redemption
(debt service), Building and Capital Reserve, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data for the
other three governmental funds (Pupil Activity Special Revenue, Tuition Special Revenue and Permanent)
is combined into a single, aggregated presentation. Individual fund data for each of these non-major
governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements included in this report.
Proprietary funds: The District uses internal service funds to account for its warehouse activities. Internal
service funds allocate costs internally among the District’s various functions while deriving revenue from
the other funds served.
Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the government-wide financial statements, only
in more detail.
Fiduciary funds: Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held by the District in a fiduciary
capacity and can only be used for specified purposes. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-
wide financial statement because the resources of those funds are not available to support the District’s
programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds.
Notes to the financial statements: The notes provide additional information essential to a full
understanding of the information provided in the financial statements.
Other information: In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report
presents required supplementary information concerning the District’s annual appropriated budgets with
comparison schedules that demonstrate compliance with budgets for the General Fund and Special Revenue
Funds.
The schedule of changes in the collective net pension liability are provided next, followed by notes to
required supplementary information. The combining statements in connection with non-major
governmental funds are presented immediately following the required supplementary information. These
are followed by budgetary comparison schedules for the District’s Building and Capital Reserve Fund. The
budgetary comparison schedules for the remaining funds follow.
The final schedules in this report provide additional information on the District’s agency fund and capital
assets.

To calculate net investment in capital assets, the original long-term debt was evaluated to ascertain the
amount of proceeds not spent, and of the amount spent, what portion of it had been used on capital assets
versus maintenance projects and other non-capital expenditures. That percentage was then applied to the
outstanding long-term debt to determine the amount applicable to capital assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
Financial Analysis of the District’s Funds
The District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal
requirements.
Governmental funds
The focus of the District’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows,
and balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the District’s financing
requirements. In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of the District’s net
resources available for spending.
Fund balance of all governmental funds is $839.4 million compared to $386.4 million in FY2015-16.
The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District. Fund balance of the General Fund at June
30, 2017 was $122.1 million, compared to $94.5 million as of June 30, 2016. This increase is primarily due
the passage of the 2016 mill levy and the timing of related program rollouts. Constraints on use of the
General fund balance include a restricted cash reserve of $27.0 million as required by TABOR and state
statute. Assigned fund balance includes $8.2 million use budgeted for subsequent year expenditure and
$15.9 million for special projects.
The Grant Special Revenue Fund as of June 30, 2017 was $17.1 million compared to $19.9 million at June
30, 2016. The fund balance is restricted to the district’s grant funded programs that generated the fund
balance.
The ProComp Special Revenue Fund as of June 30, 2017 was $11.8 million compared to $18.3 million as
of June 30, 2016. The ProComp Fund is restricted through a trust agreement for teacher-based educator
compensation. The Board of Trustees, authorized by the Trust, is responsible for monitoring how the
District spends the monies and ensuring that they are spent in accordance with the ProComp Trust
Agreement.
The Bond Redemption Fund as of June 30, 2017 was $130.1 million compared to $140.3 million as of June
30, 2016. The Bond Redemption Fund is restricted for payment of the District’s General Obligation Bond
debt service as authorized by Denver voters.
The Building Fund as of June 30, 2017 was $470.2 million compared to $87.5 million as of June 30, 2016.
The Building Fund consists of unspent proceeds from issuance of voter approved General Obligation Bonds
and is restricted for financing projects as described in the respective ballot language.
The Capital Reserve Fund as of June 30, 2017 was $84.0 million compared to $17.0 million as of June 30,
2016. The Capital Reserve Fund consists of unspent Certificates of Participation restricted for financing
capital projects and for debt service. Additionally, a portion of Capital Reserve Fund is committed for
capital projects by Board authorization, and assigned to debt service by Board adoption of the annual
budget.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
The Building Fund and Capital Reserve Funds increased by $382.8 million and $66.9 million, respectively,
as a result of the 2017 bond and COP issuance. They are offset by a decrease in the Bond Redemption Fund
of $10.1 million due to timing of upcoming debt service payments. Fund balance of the ProComp Special
Revenue Fund decreased by $6.7 million due to planned increases in program spending. The Grant Special
Reserve Fund decreased $2.8 million, through spending on grant programs that generated the fund balance.
The Food Services Fund balance increased by $144 thousand.
Proprietary funds
The District’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide
financial statements, but in more detail. The fund statements show the Internal Service Fund, the District’s
only proprietary fund, which is included with the governmental activities for the government-wide financial
statements.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
In accordance with state law, the District’s budget is prepared on a GAAP basis. The most significant
budgeted fund is the General Fund.
The difference between the General Fund original and final budget for expenditures increased by $30.1
million to fund additional resources and program rollouts due to the passage of the 2016 Mill Levy including
Early Literacy, Dual Enrollment, and Classroom Technology.
The major difference between the District’s final budget and actual expenditures relates to budgeted
reserves that were not spent.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus
and the accrual basis of accounting as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements.
Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of
the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are
levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed
by the provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the District’s governmental activities and component
units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the
various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the district
considers grant revenues to be available if they are collected within 180 days of the fiscal year-end. Property
tax and other revenues are considered available if collected within 60 days of the year-end. Expenditures
generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However debt service
expenditures as well as expenditures related to compensated absences are recorded only when payment is
due.
The District’s agency funds apply the accrual basis of accounting, but do not have a measurement focus.
The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing
accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenue and expenditures or expenses as
appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are needed.
The District reports the following major governmental funds:
General Fund - The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all
financial resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as detailed below. Primary
revenue sources for the general fund include property taxes and state equalization.
Grants Special Revenue Fund – This fund is used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources
that are restricted to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects. Both the
federal, state and local grants fund and the foundation and private grants fund account for revenue and
expenses specifically related to grants which have various restrictions based on the specific grant.

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
Food Services Special Revenue Fund – This fund accounts for the revenue and expenses related to
providing breakfast, lunch and snacks to District students and employees. Revenue sources for this fund
include federal and state grants and private sources.
ProComp Special Revenue Fund – This blended component unit is used to account for the proceeds of
voter-approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are for the
professional compensation system for teachers.
Bond Redemption Fund - The Bond Redemption Fund (debt service fund) accounts for and reports
financial resources that are restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-term general
obligation debt of the District as a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
Building Fund – This fund is used to account for and report bond funded financial resources that are
restricted to expenditure of capital outlays, including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and
other capital assets.
Capital Reserve Fund – This fund is used to accumulate non-bond funded resources, for the acquisition,
renovation and maintenance of capital assets.
The other governmental funds of the District account for resources where use is restricted to a particular
purpose and include the Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fund, Tuition Special Revenue Fund and the
Permanent Fund.
Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fund – This fund accounts for the revenue and expenditures of
sponsoring athletic events at District middle and high schools.
Tuition Special Revenue Fund – This fund accounts for revenues and expenses for providing early
childhood education and full day kindergarten. Revenues are primarily derived from tuition billings.
Permanent Fund – This fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent
that only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the District’s programs.
Additionally, the District reports the following other fund categories:
Internal Service Fund – This fund is used to account for goods and services provided to departments and
schools primarily within the District on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Fiduciary Funds – The District’s fiduciary funds include private-purpose trust funds and an agency fund.
The private-purpose trust funds of the District account for student and employee scholarships. The District’s
postemployment health benefits were transferred to PERACare on January 1, 2010. The agency fund of the
District represents the bank accounts maintained at each school to account for monies derived from school-
sponsored student activities.
Proprietary (internal service) funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services or producing and delivering
goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the District’s internal service fund are charges to customers for sales and services. Operating
expenses for the internal service fund include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses.

Indirect Costs
Indirect costs are allocated to grants in the Special Revenue Fund based on an indirect cost rate established
by the Colorado Department of Education. The indirect cost expenditure in the Special Revenue Fund is
offset against expenditures in the General Fund.
Accrued Payroll
The accrued payroll represents the liability to teachers and certain other employees who earn their salaries
over the nine-month school year but are paid over a twelve-month period from September 1 to August 31.
Changes in the accrual are reflected in expenditures or expenses on the applicable fund's statement of
revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances. Certain payroll benefits and part-time salaries which
are payable at June 30 are also included.
Compensated Absences
The compensated absence liability, consisting of accumulated sick and vacation leave which vests and is
payable upon termination or retirement, is reported on the government-wide financial statements.
Accumulated sick leave vests only at qualified retirement and vests at a rate determined by contract, which
is less than the normal rate of pay. A qualified retiree can be paid for up to one work-years’ worth of
accumulated sick leave. Retirees who accumulate vacation leave are compensated at their normal rate of
pay for the balance at retirement. On the fund financial statements, compensated absence amounts are
reported as expenditures or expenses, as appropriate, when paid.
Encumbrances
Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the
expenditures of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation, is
employed as an extension of formal budgetary integration in all funds.
Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements,
long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities or proprietary fund type statement of net position. Debt premiums and discounts are deferred
and amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
interest method. The appropriate obligations are reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and discounts during
the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums received
on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuances are reported as
other financing uses. In accordance with Section 22-45-103, CRS, the District’s bond redemption fund
custodian for fiscal year 2016-2017 was Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., third party.

Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities, and
GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB
Statement No. 27, the government-wide statements include deferred outflows of resources representing the
deferred loss on refunding of the District’s certificates of participation and bond obligations and items
relating to the District’s pension obligations and deferred inflows of resources relating to pension
obligations. Additionally, the governmental fund financial statements include deferred inflows of resources
for property taxes receivable and long-term receivables that have not met modified accrual revenue
recognition criteria.
Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets, restricted and
unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes restricted amounts for debt service, performance-
based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education, non-governmental grantor-designated
purposes, state and federal programs, permanent fund, capital projects, and donor-designated purposes.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy based
primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for which
amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances, the District considers amounts
to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for which fund balance is both available and
can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54, the fund balances of the District are classified into
the following categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in
spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact, including items that are not
expected to be converted to cash.
Restricted fund balance includes amounts where constraints have been placed on the use of resources by
either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws
or regulations of other governments; or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation.
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to
constraints imposed by the Board of Education. Committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose
unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of formal
action (for example, resolution) it employed to previously commit those amounts. Committed fund balance
also incorporates contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have been
specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.
Assigned fund balance includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be used for specific
purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. The Board of Education adopted a fund balance policy
and as part of the policy delegated the authority to the Superintendent or designee to assign amounts to be
used for specific purposes.

The District invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks
such as interest rate, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment
securities, it is possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and
that such change could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
The District does not hold any investments for the purpose of income or profit. The District categorizes its
fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting
principles. The valuation is based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs
are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than those within
Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs.
The District has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2017:
• Corporate Notes of $35,136,200 are valued using quoted market price (Level 1 inputs).
• U.S. Treasury securities of $117,640,937 are valued using quoted market price (Level 1 inputs).
• Federal Agency Bonds/Notes of $51,088,751 are valued using quoted market price (Level 1 inputs).
• Repurchase Agreements of $18,175,000 are valued using pricing models (Level 2 inputs).
Custodial Credit Risk
Colorado law requires the District to use eligible public depositories as defined by the Public
Deposit Protection Act of 1989 (the Act). Under the Act, the depository is required to pledge eligible
collateral having a market value at all times equal to 102% of the aggregate public depositories not
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Eligible collateral as defined by the Act
primarily includes obligations of, or guarantees by, the U.S. government, the State of Colorado or any
political subdivision thereof and obligations evidenced by notes secured by first lien mortgages of trust
on real property.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District will not be able to recover its
deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.
The District’s deposits are with eligible public depositories and are considered to be held in the name of the
District. These deposits have bank balances of $10,125,950 and related carrying amount of $5,090,234.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest rates. The
District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the Colorado Revised
Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing a combination of shorter and
longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is either
maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed by operations and
debt service requirements.
The following table shows the distribution of the District’s cash and cash equivalents and investments by
maturity, which displays the sensitivity of the fair values of the District’s investments, including
investments held by bond trustee, to market rate fluctuations:

In November of 1998, 2003, 2008, 2012 and 2016 the registered voters of Denver authorized the School
District to issue $305 million, $310.8 million, $454 million, $466 and $572 million respectively, of general
obligation bonds. As of June 30, 2017, substantially all previously authorized bonds had been issued.
In January of 2017, the District issued general obligation bonds in the amount of $466 million out of the

facility consolidation and sharing.
On May 1, 2013, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $58.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013C. The certificates provide funding of various projects in the Stapleton Urban

District elementary school and one additional K-8 school, and the acquisition and construction, including
site preparation, of various improvements related to a District high school and sports field. The District and
the Denver Urban Renewal Authority have entered into a 2013 Supplemental Denver Public Schools
Funding Agreement to provide reimbursement to the District for the above listed projects which will serve
as the source of repayment for the Series 2013C Certificates of Participation.
In September of 2015, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $8.9 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2015. The proceeds from the issuance used for the purchase of parking garage located
at 1855 Lincoln Street in downtown Denver and the land upon which it is located. The primary purpose is
to provide affordable and long-term parking for the users of the Emily Griffith Campus. The Certificates

The bonds are general obligations of the District. The full faith and credit of the District are pledged for the
payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds. The Board annually determines and certifies, to the
City and County of Denver a rate of levy for general ad valorem taxes, on all of the taxable property in the
District, sufficient to pay debt service on bonds when due. The Certificates of Participation are secured by
schools and administrative properties owned and operated by the District.
All bond obligations will be paid from the Bond Redemption Fund. The 2013A, 2013C, 2017A and 2017B
Certificates of Participation are to be paid from the Capital Reserve Fund; whereas the 1997, 2011B and
2013B taxable Certificates of Participation are attributable to pension obligations and are to be paid from
the General Fund. The 2015A taxable Certificates of Participation and 2015B tax-exempt Certificates of
participation are to be paid from General Fund.
The Building Fund ending fund balance of $470,254,135 is from the issuance of Series 2009A, 2009C,
2010A, 2012B, 2012C, 2014A and 2017 general obligation bonds and related interest earnings. At June 30,
2017, the School District had capital expenditure purchase commitments outstanding of $95,658,311.
Capital Lease Obligations
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the leases have been capitalized at the present
value of future minimum lease payments and the assets are reflected in the government-wide financial
statements and as of June 30, 2017 were:

Defeasance of Certificates of Participation
In prior years, the District defeased certain Certificates of Participation by placing the proceeds of the new
certificates in an irrevocable trust to provide for all future payments on the old obligations. Accordingly,
the trust account assets and the liability for the defeased obligations are not included in the District’s
financial statements.
Defeasance of General Obligation Bonds
In prior years, the District advance refunded a portion of the District’s Series 2004A, 2004C, 2009A and
2012B general obligation bonds with the proceeds from the issuance of new general obligation bonds. The
defeased bonds are not considered a liability of the District since sufficient funds were deposited with an
escrow agent and invested in government securities for the purpose of paying the principal and interest
when due. At June 30, 2017 $287,655,000 of refunded 2009A and 2012B bonds are considered defeased.
Forward Delivery Agreements
In February 2003, the District entered into a forward delivery agreement whereby it received $9.8 million
for the General Fund in exchange for the future earnings from the investment of future General Fund
revenues that will be used to meet the debt service requirements for the 1997 taxable pension certificates
of participation issue. Of this $9.8 million, $8,890,313 has been recognized as revenue, with the remaining
amount to be recognized as revenue over the remaining life of the issue or through December 2018.
Compensated Absences Payable
Compensated absences payable consists of accumulated sick leave time which vests and is payable upon
retirement and accumulated vacation leave time which vests and is payable upon retirement or termination.
On the fund financial statements, compensated absence amounts are reported as expenditures or expenses
when paid. The estimated cost for fiscal year 2017 is $2,144,705 based on recent history. These
expenditures are recognized in the fund where incurred, a majority of which are incurred by the General
Fund.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017
 Employer contributions were assumed to be made at rates equal to the fixed statutory rates specified
in law and effective as of the measurement date, including current and estimated future AED and
SAED, until the Actuarial Value Funding Ratio reaches 103%, at which point, the AED and SAED
will each drop 0.50% every year until they are zero. Additionally, estimated employer contributions
included reductions for the funding of the AIR and retiree health care benefits. For future plan
members, employer contributions were further reduced by the estimated amount of total service
costs for future plan members not financed by their member contributions.
 Employer contributions and the amount of total service costs for future plan members were based
upon a process used by the plan to estimate future actuarially determined contributions assuming
an analogous future plan member growth rate.
 The AIR balance was excluded from the initial fiduciary net position, as, per statute, AIR amounts
cannot be used to pay benefits until transferred to either the retirement benefits reserve or the
survivor benefits reserve, as appropriate. As the ad hoc post-retirement benefit increases financed
by the AIR are defined to have a present value at the long-term expected rate of return on plan
investments equal to the amount transferred for their future payment, AIR transfers to the fiduciary
net position and the subsequent AIR benefit payments have no impact on the Single Equivalent
Interest Rate (SEIR) determination process when the timing of AIR cash flows is not a factor (i.e.,
the plan’s fiduciary net position is not projected to be depleted). When AIR cash flow timing is a
factor in the SEIR determination process (i.e., the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be
depleted), AIR transfers to the fiduciary net position and the subsequent AIR benefit payments
were estimated and included in the projections.
 Benefit payments and contributions were assumed to be made at the end of the month.
Based on the above assumptions and methods, the DPS Division’s fiduciary net position was projected to
be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current members. Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return of 7.25 percent on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate determination does not use the
municipal bond index rate, and therefore, the discount rate is 7.25 percent.
As of the prior measurement date, the long-term expected rate of return of 7.50 percent on pension plan
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate determination did not use the municipal bond index rate, and therefore, the discount rate
was 7.50 percent, 0.25 percent higher compared to the current measurement date.

12.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The District is a party to numerous pending or threatened lawsuits under which it may be required to pay
certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. After consulting with counsel, the District’s
management has concluded that no significant adverse effect on the June 20, 3017 financial statements
should result upon final disposition of these proceedings.
The District has a potential liability relating to the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act),
which is a federally-funded hazardous material/asbestos management program administered by the State
Health Department. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of expenditures which will be
required to comply with the Act. It is expected that these expenditures will not have a significant impact
on the financial position of the District.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be questioned as
not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to reimbursement
to the grantor agencies. The District's management believes disallowances, if any, will be immaterial.
For the year ended June 30, 2017, the District reported a deficit net position of $1,357,144,789 in the
government-wide statements. This deficit can be partially attributed to the implementation of GASB 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27, requiring
the recognition of a long-term liability for pensions. Also, liabilities related to the District’s execution of
Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds to fund retirement and necessary capital and
maintenance projects of the District’s facilities.
As of June 30, 2017 encumbrances for governmental funds were:
Fund Encumbrances

13. CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS
At the general election held November 3, 1992, voters approved an amendment (commonly termed the
Taxpayers Bill of Rights, or TABOR) to the Colorado Constitution limiting the ability of the state and local
governments such as the District to increase revenues, debt and spending, and restricting property, income
and other taxes. On November 2, 1999 the Denver voters gave the District approval to exceed the spending
limits established in TABOR beginning with the 1999 fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the
state and local governments obtain voter approval to create any "multiple fiscal year direct or indirect debt
or other financial obligation whatsoever without adequate present cash reserves pledged irrevocably and
held for payments in all future fiscal years.” The amendment exempts from its restrictions the borrowings
and fiscal operations of enterprises. Enterprises are defined to include government owned businesses
authorized to issue their own revenue bonds and receiving under 10% of their grants from all state and local
government sources combined. The amendment also requires the establishment of an "Emergency Reserve"
equal to three percent of fiscal year spending excluding debt service.
In accordance with TABOR, the District maintains an emergency reserve of 3% of fiscal year spending by
designating real property owned by the District in lieu of cash. For fiscal year 2017, fiscal year spending
was $1,060,059,535, and the 3% emergency reserve was $31,801,786, which excludes multi-year
obligations of $134,759. Additionally, in accordance with C.R.S. Section 22-44-105, the District
established an emergency cash reserve as a restricted fund balance in the general fund for $27,033,570
equal to 3% of budgeted general fund revenues.

14. COMPONENT UNITS
The District has 30 component units consisting of two blended component units and 28 discretely presented
component units.
Change in Reporting Entity
The component unit combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity. The changes in
reporting entity include charter schools with expired charters that were not renewed (footnoted as A in the
combining statements) and charter school networks that were previously reported at the school level and
are now reported at the network level (see footnote B in the combining statements).
Blended Component Units
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c) (3) and
501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code, and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings and equipment
for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for the creation and
continued management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is ultimately responsible for
any deficits or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation issued by the DSFLC and its
activities for the year are reflected in the accompanying government-wide financial statements of the
District. An evaluation of the DSFLC using the above considerations results in its blended inclusion in the
accompanying financial statements. There are no separate financial statements available for the DSFLC
and the financial information of the DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government which is why
DSFLC is not shown on the schedules in this note.
Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System for Teachers
The Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System (“ProComp”) was established following
the approval of the 2005 Mill Levy Override as a groundbreaking compensation system that links teacher
pay to the instructional mission of the District. Designed in a partnership between the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association (DCTA) and the District, ProComp has received national attention because it rewards
teachers for their professional accomplishments while linking pay to student achievement. The financial
information of ProComp is blended with that of the primary government, which is why ProComp is not
shown on the schedules in this note.
Discretely Presented Component Units
Denver Public Schools Foundation
In 1984 the Denver Public Schools Foundation (the “Foundation”) was incorporated as a widely based not-
for-profit charitable organization whose educational purposes are to support the mission, goals and
objectives of the District. Programs administered by the foundation provide a financial benefit to the District
in the form of grants, scholarships and special projects which support innovative classroom initiatives and
enhance the educational opportunities of District students and staff. In addition, donations to the foundation
support various educational programs within the District. Even though the foundation is a separate legal
entity and the District is not financially accountable for the foundation, the foundation’s financial statements
are included as part of the District’s financial reporting entity because of the nature and significance of the
