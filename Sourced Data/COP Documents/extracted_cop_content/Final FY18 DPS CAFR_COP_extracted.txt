MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado (the District),
provides readers of the District’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) this narrative overview
and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We encourage
readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that is
presented in the letter of transmittal, which starts on page 10 of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the statement of net position, as of June 30, 2018, the District’s net position for governmental activities
is a deficit of $1,491.9 million. The deficit net position is primarily the result of two factors. The first is the
result of the District executing Certificates of Participation (COP) to fund the District’s pension plan known
as Denver Public Schools Retirement System (DPSRS) prior to its merger as a separate division within the
state’s Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA). In July of 1997, the District executed $384.2
million in Certificates of Participation with the net proceeds contributed to DPSRS. In April of 2008, the
District issued $750 million in Certificates of Participation to refund existing certificates and to fund an
additional $397.8 million contribution to DPSRS in anticipation of the merger with PERA. As a result of these
contributions, the District’s PERA division is 79.5% funded compared to the PERA School division of 44%
as of December 31, 2017. Second, in order to fund the District’s capital program, the voters of Denver
authorized General Obligation bonds in November 1998, 2003, 2008, 2012 and 2016 of $305 million, $310.8
million, $454 million, $466 million and $572 million respectively. The proceeds of these bonds are used to
fund necessary capital and maintenance of the District’s facilities. (See additional details in Note 5 and Note
6 to the financial statements).
Long-term liabilities decreased to $3,890.1 million from $3,978.3 million in FY 2018 primarily due to a
reduction in the net pension liability as well as other miscellaneous assumptions.
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $1,141.6 million or 80% of total revenues
and program revenues were $291.1 million or 20% of the total revenues of the primary government. The
total revenues increased to $1,432.7 from $1,349.5, or 6% when compared to prior year, primarily due to
increased property taxes. Net position declined year over year primarily due to the adoption of a new
accounting standard that required the District to record a liability for other postemployment obligations.
Effective July 1, 2017, the District adopted Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 75,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions. Adoption of GASB
75 resulted in the restatement of beginning net position at July 1, 2017 of $71,287,421. Prior year financial
information contained herein has not been restated for the adoption of GASB 75.
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial
statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide financial
statements, 2) fund financial statements and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains
required supplementary information and other supplementary information.
Government-wide Statements
The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with information about the
District as a whole using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector businesses.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
The statement of net position includes all of the District’s assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities
and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference reported as net position to the exclusion of fiduciary
funds. The statement of activities presents information on how the District’s net position changed during
the fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported when the underlying event giving rise to the change
occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in
this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected
taxes and retiree sick leave payable).
The government-wide financial statements consolidate the governmental and internal service activities that
are supported from taxes and intergovernmental revenues. In the government-wide financial statements,
the District’s activities are shown as:
Governmental activities: Most of the District’s basic services are included here, such as instruction,
transportation, maintenance and operations and administration. Taxes and intergovernmental revenues
principally support these activities.
The government-wide financial statements encompass not only the District itself (the primary government)
but also legally-separate entities including the ProComp Special Revenue Fund and Denver School Facilities
Leasing Corporation as blended component units and Denver Public Schools Foundation and charter schools
as discretely presented component units.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated
for specific activities or objectives. The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about
the District’s operations, focusing on its most significant or major funds, not the District as a whole. The
District has three types of funds: governmental funds, proprietary funds and fiduciary funds.
Governmental funds: Most of the District’s services are included in governmental funds, which generally
focus on (1) how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flow in and out and
(2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds
statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine the status of financial resources that
can be spent in the near future to finance the District’s programs.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. Thus,
readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.
Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures
and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to the government-wide financial statements in order
to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities. The District
maintains nine individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately in the governmental
fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in
fund balances for the General, Grants Special Revenue, Bond Redemption (debt service), Building and
Capital Reserve, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data for the other four governmental funds
(Pupil Activity Special Revenue,Food Services Special Revenue, ProComp Special Revenue and Permanent)
are combined into a single, aggregated presentation. Individual fund data for each of these nonmajor
governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements included in this report.

 The 2017 bond issuance received the following ratings:
 Moody’s ratings of Aa2
 Fitch ratings of AA+
 S&P ratings of AA
A significant portion of the District’s assets are its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings,
equipment and capital leases). The District uses these assets to provide instruction and related services to
its students. Capital assets (net) increased to $1,373.1 million in FY 2018 from $1,258.2 million in FY 2017.
The increase is primarily a result of capital spending from the District’s general obligation bonds and
certificates of participation. The District’s capital assets will continue to increase as planned projects are
completed in the Capital Reserve and Building Funds. Combined, these funds have available fund balance
of $488 million.
Current and other assets decreased to $1.02 billion from $1.07 billion primarily due to the 2017 bond and
COP’s spend as described in the capital improvements section of the Transmittal letter.
The following table provides a summary of the District’s net position as of June 30, 2018 and 2017,
respectively (in millions):
June 30, 2018 June 30, 2017
Current and other assets $ 1,017.4 $ 1,067.8
Capital assets, net 1,373.1 1,258.2
Total assets 2,390.5 2,326.0
Deferred outflow of resources 358.9 512.6
Long-term liabilities 3,890.1 3,978.3
Other liabilities 140.0 144.6
Total liabilities 4,030.1 4,122.9
Deferred inflow of resources 211.2 72.8
Net position:
Net investment in capital assets (47.5) 148.7
Restricted 650.6 648.6
Unrestricted (2,095.0) (2,154.4)
Total net position $ (1,491.9) $ (1,357.1)
To calculate net investment in capital assets, the original long-term debt was evaluated to ascertain the
amount of proceeds not spent and of the amount spent, what portion of it had been used on capital assets
versus maintenance projects and other non-capital expenditures. That percentage was then applied to the
outstanding long-term debt to determine the amount applicable to capital assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
Most revenues to Colorado's school districts are provided through the Public School Finance Act of 1994
(as amended). The District’s adjusted total program funding for FY 2018 was $690.4 million based on a
funded pupil count of 87,118 and per pupil total program funding of $7,925, compared to total program
funding of $662.7 million, funded pupil count of 86,231 and per pupil total program funding of $7,686 in
FY 2017. Of the $690.4 million adjusted program, $243.2 million was funded through state share and the
remainder through a combination of local property and specific ownership taxes compared to $296.5 million
funded through state share in FY 2017.
The District generated $796.5 million in property tax revenues in FY 2018 compared to $671.8 million in
FY 2017. Total property tax revenues include School Finance Act mills, Override Election mills, Tax
Abatement mills and Bond Redemption Fund mills. Total expenses for the primary government in FY 2018
were $1,493.2 million compared to $1,449.6 million in FY 2017. The difference was primarily due to interest
on long-term debt from the second sale of the 2016 general obligation bond and certificates of participation.
The following chart illustrates the District’s revenues by source.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
Financial Analysis of the District’s Funds
The District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal
requirements.
Governmental funds
The focus of the District’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows and
balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the District’s financing
requirements. In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of the District’s net
resources available for spending.
Fund balance of all governmental funds is $799.1 million compared to $839.4 million in FY 2017.
The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District. Fund balance of the General Fund at June
30, 2018 was $119 million, compared to $122.1 million as of June 30, 2017. This decrease is primarily due
the planned use of expenditures. Constraints on use of the General Fund balance include a restricted cash
reserve of $28.9 million as required by TABOR and state statute. Assigned fund balance includes $17.9
million use budgeted for subsequent year expenditure and $22.9 million for special projects.
The Grant Special Revenue Fund balance as of June 30, 2018 was $18.7 million compared to $17.1 million
at June 30, 2017. The fund balance is restricted to the District’s grant funded programs that generated the
fund balance.
The Bond Redemption Fund balance as of June 30, 2018 was $160.2 million compared to $130.1 million as
of June 30, 2017. The Bond Redemption Fund is restricted for payment of the District’s General Obligation
Bond debt service as authorized by Denver voters.
The Building Fund as of June 30, 2018 was $443.1 million compared to $470.2 million as of June 30, 2017.
The Building Fund consists of unspent proceeds from issuance of voter approved General Obligation Bonds
and is restricted for financing projects as described in the respective ballot language.
The Capital Reserve Fund as of June 30, 2018 was $44.9 million compared to $84 million as of June 30,
2017. The Capital Reserve Fund consists of unspent Certificates of Participation restricted for financing
capital projects and for debt service. Additionally, a portion of Capital Reserve Fund is committed for capital
projects by Board authorization and assigned to debt service by Board adoption of the annual budget.
The Building Fund and Capital Reserve Funds decreased by $27.1 million and $39.1 million respectively, as
a result of the spending from 2017 bond and COP issuances. They are offset by an increase in the Bond
Redemption Fund of $30.1 million due to timing of upcoming debt service payments. The Grant Special
Reserve Fund increased $1.6 million, through receiving grant additional grant awards that are planned for
expenditures occurring in future fiscal years.
Proprietary funds
The District’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide
financial statements, but in more detail. The fund statements show the Internal Service Fund, the District’s
only proprietary fund, which is included with the governmental activities for the government-wide financial
statements.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus
and the accrual basis of accounting as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements.
Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of
the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are
levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed
by the provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the District’s governmental activities and component
units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the
various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District
considers grant revenues to be available if they are collected within 180 days of the fiscal year-end. Property
tax and other revenues are considered available if collected within 60 days of the year-end. Expenditures
generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service
expenditures as well as expenditures related to compensated absences are recorded only when payment
is due.
The District’s agency funds apply the accrual basis of accounting, but do not have a measurement focus.
The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing
accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenue and expenditures or expenses as
appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are needed.
The District reports the following major governmental funds:
General Fund - The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for
all financial resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as detailed below. Primary
revenue sources for the general fund include property taxes, state equalization, as well as tuition billing for
early childhood education and full day kindergarten.
Grants Special Revenue Fund – This fund is used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue
sources that are restricted to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects.
Both the federal, state and local grants fund and the foundation and private grants fund account for revenue
and expenses specifically related to grants which have various restrictions based on the specific grant.

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018
Bond Redemption Fund - The Bond Redemption Fund (debt service fund) accounts for and reports
financial resources that are restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-term general
obligation debt of the District as a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
Building Fund – This fund is used to account for and report bond funded financial resources that are
restricted to expenditure of capital outlays, including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and
other capital assets.
Capital Reserve Fund – This fund is used to accumulate non-bond funded resources which include
Certificates of Participation, for the acquisition, renovation and maintenance of capital assets.
The other governmental funds of the District account for resources where use is restricted to a particular
purpose and include the Food Services Special Revenue Fund, Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fund,
ProComp Special Revenue Fund and the Permanent Fund.
Food Services Special Revenue Fund – This fund accounts for the revenue and expenses related to
providing breakfast, lunch and snacks to district students and employees. Revenue sources for this fund
include federal and state grants and private sources.
Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fund – This fund accounts for the revenue and expenditures of
sponsoring athletic events at district middle and high schools.
ProComp Special Revenue Fund – This blended component unit is used to account for the proceeds of
voter-approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are for the
professional compensation system for teachers.
Permanent Fund – This fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent
that only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the District’s programs.
Additionally, the District reports the following other fund categories:
Internal Service Fund – This fund is used to account for goods and services provided such as printing,
copying, furniture moves, recycling and postage to departments and schools primarily within the District
on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Fiduciary Funds – The District’s fiduciary funds include private-purpose trust funds and an agency fund.
The private-purpose trust funds of the District account for student and employee scholarships. The District’s
postemployment health benefits were transferred to PERACare on January 1, 2010. The agency fund of
the District represents the bank accounts maintained at each school to account for monies derived from
school-sponsored student activities.
Proprietary (internal service) funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services or producing and delivering
goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the District’s internal service fund are charges to customers for sales and services. Operating
expenses for the internal service fund include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses.

Accrued Payroll
The accrued payroll represents the liability to teachers and certain other employees who earn their salaries
over the nine-month school year but are paid over a twelve-month period from September 1 to August 31.
Changes in the accrual are reflected in expenditures or expenses on the applicable fund's statement of
revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances. Certain payroll benefits and part-time salaries which
are payable at June 30 are also included.
Compensated Absences
The compensated absence liability, consisting of accumulated sick and vacation leave which vests and is
payable upon termination or retirement, is reported on the government-wide financial statements.
Accumulated sick leave vests only at qualified retirement and vests at a rate determined by contract, which
is less than the normal rate of pay. A qualified retiree can be paid for up to one work-years’ worth of
accumulated sick leave. Retirees who accumulate vacation leave are compensated at their normal rate of
pay for the balance at retirement. On the fund financial statements, compensated absence amounts are
reported as expenditures or expenses, as appropriate, when paid.
Encumbrances
Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the
expenditures of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation, is
employed as an extension of formal budgetary integration in all funds.
Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements and proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements,
long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities or proprietary fund type statement of net position. Debt premiums and discounts are deferred
and amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
interest method. The appropriate obligations are reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and discounts during

Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets, restricted
and unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes restricted amounts for debt service,
performance-based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education, non-governmental
grantor-designated purposes, state and federal programs, permanent fund, capital projects and donor-
designated purposes.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy based
primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for
which amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances, the District considers
amounts to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for which fund balance is both
available and can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54, the fund balances of the District are
classified into the following categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in
spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact, including items that are not
expected to be converted to cash.
Restricted fund balance includes amounts where constraints have been placed on the use of resources by
either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws
or regulations of other governments; or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation.
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to
constraints imposed by the Board of Education. Committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose
unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of formal
action (for example, resolution) it employed to previously commit those amounts. Committed fund balance
also incorporates contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have been
specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.
Assigned fund balance includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be used for specific
purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. The Board of Education adopted a fund balance policy
and as part of the policy delegated the authority to the Superintendent or designee to assign amounts to
be used for specific purposes.
Unassigned fund balance represents residual fund balance that has not been restricted, committed or
assigned. Positive unassigned fund balance can only be reported in the general fund while negative
unassigned fund balance may be reported in any governmental fund. General Fund when expenditures
incurred for specific purposes exceed amounts restricted, committed or assigned to those purposes.
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is
available, the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first. When an expenditure is incurred
for which committed, assigned, or unassigned fund balances are available, the District considers amounts
to have been spent first out of committed funds, then assigned funds and finally unassigned funds, as
needed, unless the Board of Education has provided otherwise in its commitment or assignment actions.

2. CASH AND INVESTMENTS
Investments Authorized by the Colorado Statutes and District’s Investment Policy
The table below identifies the investment types that are authorized by the District’s investment policy or
Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS), where more restrictive. The table also identifies certain provisions of the
District’s investment policy that address interest rate risk, credit risk and concentration of credit risk. The
table does not address the investments of (a) debt proceeds that are governed by the provisions of the
debt agreements of the District, or (b) Special Revenue ProComp Trust assets that are governed by the
Trust’s Investment Policy Statement rather than the general provisions of the District’s investment policy.
As of June 30, 2018 the District investments were in compliance with the policy.
Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements
The District has entered into a forward delivery agreement with US Bank with a maturity date of December
2023 and a forward delivery agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank with a maturity date of December
2018. The provisions of the contracts and not the District’s investment policy govern the forward delivery
investments. Under the terms of the contracts, the District recorded interest received in advance as
unearned revenue in the General Fund.
The District invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks
such as interest rate and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities,
it is possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such
change could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally
accepted accounting principles. The valuation is based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the
asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are inputs other

than those within Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 inputs are significant
unobservable inputs.
The District has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2018:
 Corporate Notes of $51,873,848 are valued using quoted market price or other observable inputs
(Level 2 inputs).
 U.S. Treasury securities of $182,736,081 are valued using quoted price in active markets for
identical assets (Level 1 inputs).
 Federal Agency Bonds/Notes of $50,660,445 are valued using quoted market price or other
observable inputs (Level 2 inputs).
 Repurchase Agreements of $21,285,000 are valued using pricing models (Level 2 inputs).
Custodial Credit Risk
Colorado law requires the District to use eligible public depositories as defined by the Public Deposit
Protection Act of 1989 (the Act). Under the Act, the depository is required to pledge eligible collateral
having a market value at all times equal to 102% of the aggregate public depositories not insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Eligible collateral as defined by the Act primarily includes obligations
of, or guarantees by, the U.S. government, the State of Colorado or any political subdivision thereof and
obligations evidenced by notes secured by first lien mortgages of trust on real property.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District will not be able to recover its
deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.
The District’s deposits are with eligible public depositories and are considered to be held in the name of
the District. These deposits have bank balances of $12,964,464 and related carrying amount of $6,350,748.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest rates. The
District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the Colorado Revised
Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing a combination of shorter
and longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is
either maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed by
operations and debt service requirements.

In prior years, the registered voters of Denver authorized the School District to issue general obligation
bonds. In January of 2018, the District issued the remaining $105.3 million of authorized bonds from the
$572 million originally approved in 2016. As of June 30, 2018, all previously authorized bonds had been
issued.
On May 1, 2013, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $58.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013C. The certificates provided funding of various projects in the Stapleton Urban
Redevelopment Area consisting of the acquisition, improvement, and placement in service of one additional
District elementary school and one additional K-8 school, and the acquisition and construction, including
site preparation, of various improvements related to a District high school and sports field. The District and
the Denver Urban Renewal Authority have entered into a 2013 Supplemental Denver Public Schools Funding
Agreement to provide reimbursement to the District for the above listed projects which will serve as the
source of repayment for the Series 2013C Certificates of Participation.
In September of 2015, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $8.9 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2015A&B. The proceeds from the issuance used for the purchase of parking garage
located at 1855 Lincoln Street in downtown Denver and the land upon which it is located.
The primary purpose is to provide affordable and long-term parking for the users of the Emily Griffith
Campus. The Certificates evidence undivided interests in the right to receive certain revenues payable by
the District under an annually renewed Lease Purchase Agreement dated on October 5, 2015.
In May of 2017, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $32 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2017A and $14 million of Certificates of Participation, Series 2017B. The purpose of
the 2017A issuance was to construct the Stapleton Park Street School, an elementary school located in the
Stapleton neighborhood of Denver. The proceeds from 2017B issuance were used to purchase a school site
on which Stapleton Park Street School will be built on and to help fund of the design and construction cost
of a fire station near the school site to meet safety standards for DPS schools within Stapleton.

In November of 2017, as authorized by the Board resolution, the District issued $10 million Refunding
Certificate of Participation, Series 2017C. The proceeds for the issuance in combination with the proceeds
received from the sale of EGOS properties used to current refunding of $35.195 million of 2013A Certificate

value of the difference between the old and the new debt service) of $3,083,520.
In February of 2018, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $7.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2018. The proceeds from the issuance used for the purchase of a building located at

The bonds are general obligations of the District. The full faith and credit of the District are pledged for the
payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds. The Board annually determines and certifies, to the
City and County of Denver a rate of levy for general ad valorem taxes, on all of the taxable property in the
District, sufficient to pay debt service on bonds when due. The Certificates of Participation are secured by
schools and administrative properties owned and operated by the District.
All bond obligations will be paid from the Bond Redemption Fund. The 2013C, 2017A, 2017B, 2017C and
2018 Certificates of Participation are to be paid from the Capital Reserve Fund; whereas the 2011B and
2013B taxable Certificates of Participation are attributable to pension obligations and are paid from the
General Fund. The 2015A taxable Certificates of Participation and 2015B tax-exempt Certificates of
participation are paid from General Fund.
The Building Fund ending fund balance of $443,137,420 is from the issuance of Series 2009B, 2009C,
2010A, 2012B, 2012C, 2014A, 2017, and 2018 general obligation bonds and related interest earnings. At

Defeasance of General Obligation Bonds
On January 17, 2018, the District advance refunded a portion of the District’s Series 2009F, 2012A and
2012B general obligation bonds with the proceeds from the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds,
Series 2018B, with an average rate of 2.96%. The defeased bonds are not considered to be the liability of
the District since sufficient funds of $105,511,797 were deposited into irrevocable escrow account and
invested in U.S. government securities for the purpose of paying principal and interest when due and
redeeming outstanding bond with the first optional redemption date. The total debt service on the 2018B
refunding bonds will be $120,001,758 through December 2032 for a decrease of $20,925,491 from prior
debt service on 2009F, 2012A and 2012B bonds. The refunding results in a present value saving to the
District and taxpayers of Denver of $4,590,159.
In prior years, the District advance refunded a portion of the District’s Series 2004A, 2004C, 2009A and
2012B general obligation bonds with the proceeds from the issuance of new general obligation bonds. The
defeased bonds are not considered a liability of the District. At June 30, 2018 $381,820,000 of refunded
2009A, 2009F, 2012A, and 2012B bonds are considered legally defeased.

Forward Delivery Agreements
In February 2003, the District entered into a forward delivery agreement whereby it received $9.8 million
for the General Fund in exchange for the future earnings from the investment of future General Fund
revenues that will be used to meet the debt service requirements for the 1997 taxable pension certificates
of participation issue. Of this $9.8 million, $9,503,438 has been recognized as revenue, with the remaining
amount to be recognized as revenue over the remaining life of the issue or through December 2018.
Compensated Absences Liability
Compensated absences liability consists of accumulated sick leave time which vests and is payable upon
retirement and accumulated vacation leave time which vests and is payable upon retirement or termination.
On the fund financial statements, compensated absence amounts are reported as expenditures or expenses
when paid. The estimated cost for fiscal year 2019 is $2,131,934 based on recent history. These
expenditures are recognized in the fund where incurred, a majority of which are incurred by the General
Fund.

future plan members, employer contributions were further reduced by the estimated amount of
total service costs for future plan members not financed by their member contributions.
 Employer contributions and the amount of total service costs for future plan members were based
upon a process used by the plan to estimate future actuarially determined contributions assuming
an analogous future plan member growth rate.
 The AIR balance was excluded from the initial fiduciary net position, as, per statute, AIR amounts
cannot be used to pay benefits until transferred to either the retirement benefits reserve or the
survivor benefits reserve, as appropriate. As the ad hoc post-retirement benefit increases financed
by the AIR are defined to have a present value at the long-term expected rate of return on plan
investments equal to the amount transferred for their future payment, AIR transfers to the fiduciary
net position and the subsequent AIR benefit payments have no impact on the Single Equivalent
Interest Rate (SEIR) determination process when the timing of AIR cash flows is not a factor (i.e.,
the plan’s fiduciary net position is not projected to be depleted). When AIR cash flow timing is a
factor in the SEIR determination process (i.e., the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be
depleted), AIR transfers to the fiduciary net position and the subsequent AIR benefit payments
were estimated and included in the projections.
 Benefit payments and contributions were assumed to be made at the end of the month.

Actuarial assumptions The total OPEB liability in the July 1, 2017 actuarial valuation was determined
using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless
otherwise specified:
Actuarial cost method Entry Age Normal - Level Pay
Last experience study Not applicable since only standard tables are
used due to credibility constraints for actual
experience.
Long-term investment rate of return, net of OPEB
plan investment expenses, including price inflation 3.50 percent
Discount rate 3.50 percent
Mortality table - RP 2014 headcount weighted adjusted to 2006 with generational projection according to
Scale MP-2017
Mortality rates were based on the RP 2014 Headcount-Weighted Healthy Annuitant Total Dataset Mortality
Table, and the RP 2014 Headcount-Weighted Disabled Retiree Mortality Table, both were adjusted to
2006, separately for males and females. Mortality includes a generational projection for future mortality
improvements using Scale MP-2017.
Discount rate The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 3.50%. The discount rate
is based on management assumptions and estimates of asset composition, and long-term expected
interest rate returns. In estimating the discount rate the District believes the OPEB plan’s fiduciary net
position is projected to be sufficient to make projected benefit payments and OPEB plan assets are
expected to be invested using a strategy to achieve that return. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB
plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected OPEB payments for current
retirees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all
periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability. The discount rate did not
change since the prior measurement date.
Plan assets The LIFA Fund is invested in the MetLife General Account and expected return on assets is
based on a combination of the Bloomberg Barclays Capital Government/Credit Bond and the Bloomberg
Barclays Capital Government/Credit Long Indices.
Expected Real
Asset Class Allocation Rate of Return

12.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The District is a party to numerous pending or threatened lawsuits under which it may be required to pay
certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. After consulting with counsel, the District’s
management has concluded that no significant adverse effect on the June 30, 2018 financial statements
should result upon final disposition of these proceedings.
The District has a potential liability relating to the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act),
which is a federally-funded hazardous material/asbestos management program administered by the State
Health Department. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of expenditures, which will be
required to comply with the Act. It is expected that these expenditures will not have a significant impact
on the financial position of the District.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be questioned
as not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to
reimbursement to the grantor agencies. The District's management believes disallowances, if any, will be
immaterial.
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District reported a deficit net position of $1,491,863,181 in the
government-wide statements. This deficit can be partially attributed to the implementation of GASB 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27 and GASB
75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions requiring the
recognition of a long-term liability for pensions and postemployment benefits other than pensions
respectively. Also, liabilities related to the District’s execution of Certificates of Participation and General
Obligation bonds to fund retirement and necessary capital and maintenance projects of the District’s
facilities.
As of June 30, 2018 encumbrances for governmental funds were:
Fund Encumbrances
Building $ 94,319,468
General 36,140,149
Capital Reserve 14,713,795
Grant Special Revenue Fund 5,117,060
Nonmajor Funds 429,276
Total $ 150,719,748
Building Fund encumbrances include commitments towards major construction projects such as the Paul
Sandoval Campus, George Washington cooling and renovation and a new addition at Del Pueblo and a new
cafeteria at Colorado Heights University. The District also has commitments for a districtwide project to
upgrade LED lighting.
General Fund encumbrances include significant commitments to the District’s health care plans and utility
costs as well as normal districtwide and school level operations.
Capital Reserve Fund encumbrances include commitments towards major construction projects like the new
Stapleton Park Street school building and site improvements at Swansea.

13. CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS
At the general election held November 3, 1992, voters approved an amendment (commonly termed the
Taxpayers Bill of Rights, or TABOR) to the Colorado Constitution limiting the ability of the state and local
governments such as the District to increase revenues, debt and spending and restricting property, income
and other taxes. On November 2, 1999 the Denver voters gave the District approval to exceed the spending
limits established in TABOR beginning with the 1999 fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the
state and local governments obtain voter approval to create any "multiple fiscal year direct or indirect debt
or other financial obligation whatsoever without adequate present cash reserves pledged irrevocably and
held for payments in all future fiscal years.” The amendment exempts from its restrictions the borrowings
and fiscal operations of enterprises. Enterprises are defined to include government owned businesses
authorized to issue their own revenue bonds and receiving under 10% of their grants from all state and
local government sources combined. The amendment also requires the establishment of an "Emergency
Reserve" equal to three percent of fiscal year spending excluding debt service.
In accordance with TABOR, the District maintains an emergency reserve of 3% of fiscal year spending by
designating real property owned by the District in lieu of cash. For FY 2018, fiscal year spending was
$1,123,057,222 and the 3% emergency reserve was $33,691,717, which excludes multi-year
obligations of $153,053. Additionally, in accordance with C.R.S. Section 22-44-105, the District established
an emergency cash reserve as a restricted fund balance in the general fund for $28,893,630 equal to 3%
of budgeted general fund revenues.

14. COMPONENT UNITS
The District has 30 component units consisting of two blended component units and 28 discretely presented
component units.
Change in Reporting Entity
The component unit combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity. The changes in
reporting entity include charter schools with expired charters that were not renewed (footnoted as A in the
combining statements) and charter school networks that were previously reported at the school level and
are now reported at the network level (see footnote B in the combining statements).
Blended Component Units
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c) (3) and
501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings and equipment
for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for the creation and continued
management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is ultimately responsible for any deficits
or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation issued by the DSFLC and its activities for the year
are reflected in the accompanying government-wide financial statements of the District. An evaluation of
the DSFLC using the above considerations results in its blended inclusion in the accompanying financial
statements. There are no separate financial statements available for the DSFLC and the financial
information of the DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government which is why DSFLC is not shown
on the schedules in this note.
Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System for Teachers
The Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System (ProComp) was established following the
approval of the 2005 Mill Levy Override as a groundbreaking compensation system that links teacher pay
to the instructional mission of the District. Designed in a partnership between the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association (DCTA) and the District, ProComp has received national attention because it rewards
teachers for their professional accomplishments while linking pay to student achievement. The financial
information of ProComp is blended with that of the primary government, which is why ProComp is not
shown on the schedules in this note. ProComp is presented as a component unit because it is a separate
legal entity and is financially accountable to the District.
Discretely Presented Component Units
Denver Public Schools Foundation
In 1984 the Denver Public Schools Foundation (the Foundation) was incorporated as a widely based not-
for-profit charitable organization whose educational purposes are to support the mission, goals and
objectives of the District. Programs administered by the foundation provide a financial benefit to the District
in the form of grants, scholarships and special projects which support innovative classroom initiatives and
enhance the educational opportunities of District students and staff. In addition, donations to the
foundation support various educational programs within the District. Even though the foundation is a
separate legal entity and the District is not financially accountable for the foundation, the foundation’s
financial statements are included as part of the District’s financial reporting entity because of the nature
and significance of the relationship between the primary government and the foundation. The foundation
solicits donations and manages those funds for the benefit of the students and District.
