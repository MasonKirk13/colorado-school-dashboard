MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado (the
“District”), provides readers of the District’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report this narrative
overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. We
encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that
is presented in the letter of transmittal, which starts on page seven of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the Statement of Net Position, as of June 30, 2015, the District’s net position for governmental activities
is a deficit net position of $1.19 billion. The deficit net position is primarily the result of three factors. The
first is the result of the District executing Certificates of Participation to fund the District’s pension plan
known as Denver Public Schools Retirement System (DPSRS) prior to its merger as a separate division
within the state’s Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA). In July of 1997, the District executed
$384.2 million in Certificates of Participation with the net proceeds contributed to DPSRS. In April of 2008,
the District issued $750 million in Certificates of Participation to refund existing certificates and to fund an
additional $397.8 million contribution to DPSRS in anticipation of the merger with PERA. As a result of
these contributions, the District’s PERA division is 83.9% funded compared to the PERA School division of
64.2% as of December 31, 2014. Second, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 the District implemented
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting
for Pensions. As a result of the implementation, a net pension liability is created to represent the actuarially
determined present value of future pension benefit payments. The District has no legal obligation to fund
any shortfall nor does it have any liability to affect funding, benefits, or annual required contribution
decisions made by PERA. The change in accounting principle restated the beginning net position by a
decrease of $469 million dollars for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Third, in order to fund the
District’s capital program, the voters of Denver authorized General Obligation bonds in November 1998,
2003, 2008 and 2012 of $305 million, $310.8 million, $454 million, and $466 million respectively. The
proceeds of these bonds were used to fund necessary capital and maintenance of the District’s facilities,
some of which were not capitalized.
Long-term liabilities increased to $3,120.4 million from $2,595.1 million in FY 2014 primarily due to the
implementation of GASB Statement No. 68.
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $921 million or 77% of total revenues, and
program revenues were $275.6 million or 23% of the total revenues of the primary government. The total
revenues increased from $1,139.1 to $1,196.6, or 5% when compared to prior year primarily due to increased
property taxes and state equalization driven by increased student count.
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial
statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide financial
statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains
required supplementary information and other supplementary information.

understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions. Both the governmental
fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund
balances provide a reconciliation to the government-wide financial statements in order to facilitate this
comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities.
The District maintains ten individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately in the
governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and
changes in fund balances for the general, grants special revenue, food service special revenue, ProComp
special revenue, bond redemption (debt service), capital projects building and capital reserve, all of which
are considered to be major funds. Data for the other three governmental funds (pupil activity, tuition special
revenue and permanent) is combined into a single, aggregated presentation. Individual fund data for each of
these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements included in this report.
Proprietary funds: The District uses internal service funds to account for its warehouse activities. Internal
service funds allocate costs internally among the District’s various functions while deriving revenue from the
other funds served. In previous years the District used an internal service fund for its risk management
activities and enterprise fund for food service activities. These funds are now accounted for in the general
and food service special revenue funds, respectively. See Note 14 for more details regarding the fund
changes.
Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the government-wide financial statements, only in
more detail.
Fiduciary funds: Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held by the District in a fiduciary
capacity and can only be used for specified purposes. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-
wide financial statement because the resources of those funds are not available to support the District’s
programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds.
Notes to the financial statements: The notes provide additional information essential to a full
understanding of the information provided in the financial statements.
Other information: In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report
presents required supplementary information concerning the District’s annual appropriated budgets with
comparison schedules that demonstrate compliance with budgets for the general fund and special revenue
funds. In addition, two schedules related to other post-employment benefits are included in this section.
The combining statements in connection with nonmajor governmental funds are presented immediately
following the required supplementary information. These are followed by budgetary comparison schedules
for the District’s building and capital reserve fund. The budgetary comparison schedules for the remaining
funds follow. The combining statements for the internal service funds and the schedule of changes in the
collective net pension liability are provided next.
The final schedules in this report provide additional information on the District’s agency fund and capital
assets.

Financial Analysis of the District
A significant portion of the District’s assets are its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, and
equipment). The District uses these assets to provide instruction and related services to its students. Capital
assets (net) increased from $950 million in 2014 to $1.1 billion in 2015. The increase is primarily a result of
capital spending from the District’s general obligation bonds and certificates of participation. The District’s
capital assets will continue to increase as planned projects are completed in the Capital Reserve and Building
Fund. Combined, these funds have available fund balance of $227.1 million.
Current and other assets decreased from $920.8 million to $714.7 million primarily due to receipt of
proceeds from General Obligation Bonds, Capital Leases and Certificates as described in the Capital
Improvement Plan in the Letter of Transmittal.

To calculate net investment in capital assets, the original long-term debt was evaluated to ascertain
the amount of proceeds not spent, and of the amount spent, what portion of it had been used on
capital assets versus maintenance projects and other non-capital expenditures. That percentage was
then applied to the outstanding long-term debt to determine the amount applicable to capital assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
Financial Analysis of the District’s Funds
The District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal
requirements.
Governmental funds
The focus of the District’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and
balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the District’s financing
requirements. In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of the District’s net
resources available for spending.
Fund balance of all governmental funds decreased by $217.9 million. This decrease is primarily due to
decreases of $186.9 million in building fund balance, $25.6 million in capital reserve fund and $13.3 million
in ProComp special revenue fund balance. The decreases in these fund balances are a result of planned
capital spending and planned spending of ProComp fund balance.
General Fund
The general fund is the primary operating fund of the District. Fund balance of the general fund at June 30,
2015 was $106.5 million, compared to $106.7 million as of June 30, 2014.
Other major governmental funds
The grant special revenue fund balance increased $1.7 million due to additional state grant funding during
the year. Fund balance of the ProComp special revenue fund decreased by $13.3 million due to planned
increases in program spending. The bond redemption fund increased $4.1 million due to timing of upcoming
debt service payments.
Proprietary funds
The District’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide
financial statements, but in more detail. The fund statements show the internal service funds, which are
included with the governmental activities for the government-wide financial statements.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
The District’s budget is prepared in accordance with state law on a GAAP basis except for the general,
capital reserve, and building funds, which are budgeted on the budgetary basis and adjusts for salary accruals
and encumbrances. The most significant budgeted fund is the general fund.
The difference between the general fund original and final budget for expenditures was an overall increase of
$13.2 million and primarily attributable to an increase in funded students relative to the prior year resulting
in staffing increases and related expenses to support enrollment growth.
The major difference between the District’s final budget and actual expenditures relates to approximately
$44.9 million of budgeted reserves that were not spent.

IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus
and the accrual basis of accounting as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements.
Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of
the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are
levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements
imposed by the provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the district’s governmental activities and component
units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the
various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the
district considers grant revenues to be available if they are collected within 180 days of the fiscal year-
end. Property tax and other revenues are considered available if collected within 60 days of the year-end.
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However
debt service expenditures as well as expenditures related to compensated absences are recorded only
when payment is due.
The district’s agency funds apply the accrual basis of accounting, but do not have a measurement focus.
The accounts of the district are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing
accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenue and expenditures or expenses as
appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are needed.
The district reports the following major governmental funds:
General fund - The general fund is the general operating fund of the district. It is used to account for all
financial resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as detailed below. Primary
revenue sources for the general fund include property taxes and state equalization.
Grants special revenue fund – The special revenue fund is used to account for the proceeds of specific
revenue sources that are restricted to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital
projects. Both the Federal, State and local grants fund and the foundation and private grants fund account
for revenue and expenses specifically related to grants which have various restrictions based on the
specific grant.

Food service special revenue fund – The food services fund was previously classified as an enterprise
fund. This fund accounts for the revenue and expenses related to providing breakfast, lunches and snacks
to district students and employees. Revenue sources for this fund include federal and state grants and
private sources.
ProComp special revenue fund – This special revenue fund is used to account for the proceeds of voter-
approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. Its investments and expenditures are for the
professional compensation system for teachers.
Bond redemption fund - The bond redemption fund (debt service fund) accounts for and reports
financial resources that are restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-term general
obligation debt of the district as a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
Building fund – The building fund (capital projects fund) is used to account for and report bond funded
financial resources that are restricted to expenditure of capital outlays, including the acquisition or
construction of capital facilities and other capital assets.
Capital reserve fund – The capital reserve fund (capital projects fund) is used to accumulate non bond
funded resources, for the acquisition, renovation and maintenance of capital assets.
The other governmental funds of the district account for resources for which use is restricted to a
particular purpose and include the pupil activity fund and the permanent government fund.
Pupil activity fund – The pupil activity special revenue fund accounts for the revenue and expenditures
of sponsoring athletic events at district middle and high schools.
Tuition special revenue fund – The tuition special revenue fund accounts for revenues and expenses for
providing early childhood education and full day kindergarten. Revenues are primarily derived from
tuition billings.
Permanent fund – This fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent
that only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the district’s programs.
Additionally, the district reports the following other fund categories:
Internal service fund – the internal service fund is used to account for goods and services provided to
departments and schools primarily within the district on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Fiduciary funds – The district’s fiduciary funds include private-purpose trust funds, an Other Post
Employment Benefit (OPEB) trust and an agency fund. The private-purpose trust funds of the District
account for student and employee scholarships. The Retiree Life Insurance Trust accounts for the
District’s OPEB. The District’s postemployment health benefits were transferred to PERACare on
January 1, 2010. The agency fund of the district represents the bank accounts maintained at each school
to account for monies derived from school-sponsored student activities.

Indirect Costs
Indirect costs are allocated to grants in the special revenue fund based on an indirect cost rate established
by the Colorado Department of Education. The indirect cost expenditure in the special revenue fund is
offset against expenditures in the general fund.
Accrued Payroll
The accrued payroll represents the liability to teachers and certain other employees who earn their salaries
over the nine-month school year but are paid over a twelve-month period from September 1 to August 31.
Changes in the accrual are reflected in expenditures or expenses on the applicable fund's statement of
revenue, expenditures and changes in fund balance. Certain payroll benefits and part-time salaries which
are payable at June 30 are also included.
Compensated Absences
The compensated absence liability, consisting of accumulated sick and vacation leave which vests and is
payable upon termination or retirement, is reported on the government-wide financial statements.
Accumulated sick leave vests only at qualified retirement and vests at a rate determined by contract,
which is less than the normal rate of pay. A qualified retiree can be paid for up to one work-years’ worth
of accumulated sick leave. Retirees who accumulate vacation leave are compensated at their normal rate
of pay for the balance at retirement. On the fund financial statements, compensated absence amounts are
reported as expenditures or expenses, as appropriate, when paid.
Encumbrances
Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the
expenditures of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation, is
employed as an extension of formal budgetary integration in all funds.
Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements,
long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities or proprietary fund type statement of net position. Debt premiums and discounts are deferred
and amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
interest method. The appropriate obligations are reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and discounts during
the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums
received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuances are
reported as other financing uses. In accordance with Section 22-45-103, CRS, the District’s bond
redemption fund custodian for fiscal year 2014-2015 was Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., third party.

Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities, and
GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB
Statement No. 27, the government-wide statements include deferred outflows of resources representing
the deferred loss on refundings of the district’s certificates of participation and bond obligations and items
relating to the District’s pension obligations and deferred inflows of resources relating to pension
obligations. Additionally, the governmental fund financial statements include deferred inflows of
resources for property taxes receivable and long-term receivables that have not met modified accrual
revenue recognition criteria.
Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets, restricted and
unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes restricted amounts for debt service,
performance-based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education, non-governmental
grantor-designated purposes, state and federal programs, permanent fund, capital projects, and donor-
designated purposes.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy based
primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for
which amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances, the District considers
amounts to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for which fund balance is both
available and can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54, the fund balances of the District are
classified into the following categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in
spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact, including items that are
not expected to be converted to cash.
Restricted fund balance includes amounts where constraints have been placed on the use of resources by
either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws
or regulations of other governments; or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling
legislation.
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to
constraints imposed by the Board of Education. Committed amounts cannot be used for any other
purpose unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of
formal action (for example, resolution) it employed to previously commit those amounts. Committed
fund balance also incorporates contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund
have been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.
Assigned fund balance includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be used for
specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. The Board of Education adopted a fund

The District has entered into a forward delivery agreement with US Bank with a maturity date of
December 2023 and a forward delivery agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank with a maturity date of
December 2018. The provisions of the contracts and not the District’s investment policy govern the
forward delivery investments. Under the terms of the contracts, the District recorded interest received in
advance as deferred revenue in the general fund.
The following table shows the distribution of the District’s cash and cash equivalents and investments by
maturity, which displays the sensitivity of the fair values of the District’s investments (including
investments held by bond trustee) to market rate fluctuations:

As of August 9, 2006 when HB 1287 was signed, investments held in the ProComp special revenue fund
and administered by the ProComp Trust are exempt from the investment restrictions placed on local
governments. Consequently the trust’s board of directors adopted an investment policy statement which
authorizes domestic and international equity securities, fixed income securities, and alternative
investments including hedging strategies.
The district invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks
such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment
securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in
the near term and that such change could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements.

Colorado law requires the district to use eligible public depositories as defined by the Public Deposit
Protection Act of 1989 (the Act). Under the Act, the depository is required to pledge eligible collateral
having a market value at all times equal to 102% of the aggregate public depositories not insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Eligible collateral as defined by the Act primarily includes
obligations of, or guarantees by, the U.S. government, the State of Colorado or any political subdivision
thereof and obligations evidenced by notes secured by first lien mortgages of trust on real property.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District will not be able to recover
its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.
The District’s deposits are with eligible public depositories and are considered to be held in the name of
the District. These deposits have bank balances of $8,762,832 and related carrying amount of
$3,000,985.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment. The District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the
Colorado Revised Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing a
combination of shorter and longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a
portion of the portfolio is either maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide the cash flow and
liquidity needed by operations and debt service requirements.

On November 3, 1998, November 4, 2003, November 4, 2008 and November 6, 2012 the registered
voters of Denver authorized the School District to issue $305 million, $310.8 million, $454 million, and
$466 million respectively, of general obligation bonds. As of June 30, 2015, substantially all previously
authorized bonds had been issued.
The Certificates of Participation series 1997 were executed to fund Denver Public Schools Retirement
System (DPSRS) pension plan Unfunded Accrued Actuarial Liability (UAAL).
On January 31, 2013 as authorized by Board resolution, the District entered into Lease Purchase
Financing Series 2013 for a principal amount of $35.2 million. These funds along with funding from the
2012 general obligation bonds were used to purchase and refurbish the District’s downtown campus
located at 1860 Lincoln. The building houses the central administrative functions of the District, the
Emily Griffith Technical College (EGTC) and High School (EGHS) programs, and the new Downtown
Denver Expeditionary School (DDES.) The downtown campus creates financial benefits for the District
and taxpayers through facility consolidation and sharing.
On May 1, 2013 as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $58.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013C. The certificates provide funding of various projects in the Stapleton Urban
Redevelopment Area consisting of the acquisition, improvement, and placement in service of one
additional District elementary school and one additional K-8 school, and the acquisition and construction,
including site preparation, of various improvements related to a District high school and sports field. The
District and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority have entered into a 2013 Supplemental Denver Public
Schools Funding Agreement to provide reimbursement to the District for the above listed projects which
will serve as the source of repayment for the Series 2013C Certificates of Participation.

The Bonds are general obligations of the District. The full faith and credit of the District are pledged for
the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Board annually determines and certifies, to
the City and County of Denver, a rate of levy for general ad valorem taxes, without limitation as to rate or
amount, on all of the taxable property in the District, sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the
Bonds when due. The Certificate of Participation are secured by schools and administrative properties
owned and operated by the District.
All bond obligations will be paid from the bond redemption fund. The 2013A and 2013C Certificates of
Participation are to be paid from the capital projects fund - capital reserve fund; whereas the 1997, 2011B
and 2013B taxable certificates of participation are attributable to pension obligations and are to be paid
from the general fund.
The capital projects building fund balance of $207,662,167 is from the issuance of Series 2009A, 2009C,
2010A, 2012B, 2012C and 2014A general obligation bonds and related interest earnings. At June 30,
2015, the District had capital expenditure purchase commitments outstanding of $78,082,649.
Defeasance of Certificates of Participation
In prior years, the District defeased certain certificates of participation by placing the proceeds of the
new certificates in an irrevocable trust to provide for all future payments on the old obligations.
Accordingly, the trust account assets and the liability for the defeased obligations are not included in the
District’s financial statements. At June 30, 2015, $15,368,447 of outstanding certificates of participation
are considered defeased.
Defeasance of General Obligation Bonds
On December 3, 2014, the District advance refunded the District’s series 2009A general obligation bonds
with an average interest rate of 5.161%, the proceeds from the issuance of series 2014B general obligation
bonds dated December 3, 2014, with an average interest rate of 4.722%. The defeased bonds are not
considered a liability of the District since sufficient funds of $172,654,770 were deposited with an escrow
agent in previous years and invested in Federal securities for the purpose of paying the principal and
interest when due. Total debt service on the 2014B refunding bonds will be $226,083,719 through
December 2029 for a decrease of $17,057,543 from the debt service on the 2009A bonds of $243,414,263
through December 2029; however, the District will experience an economic gain (difference between the
present values of the debt service payments on the old and new debt) of $10,019,356.
In prior year’s the District advance refunded a portion of the District’s Series 2004A and 2004C general
obligation bonds with the proceeds from the issuance of new general obligation bonds. The defeased
bonds are not considered a liability of the District since sufficient funds were deposited with an escrow
agent and invested in government securities for the purpose of paying the principal and interest when due.
At June 30, 2015, $149,170,000 of refunded 2009A bonds are considered defeased.

Forward Delivery Agreements
In February 2003, the District entered into a forward delivery agreement whereby it received $9.8 million
for the general fund in exchange for the future earnings from the investment of future general fund
revenues that will be used to meet the debt service requirements for the 1997 taxable pension certificates
of participation issue. Of this $9.8 million, $7,664,063 has been recognized as revenue with the remaining
amount to be recognized as revenue over the remaining life of the issue or through December 2018.
Compensated Absences Payable
Compensated absences payable consists of accumulated sick leave time which vests and is payable upon
retirement and accumulated vacation leave time which vests and is payable upon retirement or
termination. On the fund financial statements, compensated absence amounts are reported as expenditures
or expenses when paid. These expenditures are recognized in the fund where incurred, a majority of
which are incurred by the general fund. The estimated cost for fiscal year 2015 is $2,088,180 based on
recent history and is reported in the Due within one year category on the statement of Net Position.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The district is a party to numerous pending or threatened lawsuits under which it may be required to pay
certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. After consulting with counsel, the district's
management has concluded that no significant adverse effect on the June 30, 2015 financial statements
should result upon final disposition of these proceedings. The district has a potential liability relating to
the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act), which is a federally-funded hazardous
material/asbestos management program administered by the State Health Department. It is not possible at
this time to estimate the amount of expenditures which will be required to comply with the Act. It is
expected that these expenditures will not have a significant impact on the financial position of the district.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be questioned
as not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to
reimbursement to the grantor agencies. The district's management believes disallowances, if any, will be
immaterial.
The district has several computer and copier lease agreements which contain a provision whereby the
leases shall terminate if the Board of Education does not appropriate funds for lease payments in any
succeeding year. There are no contingent rental payments, escalation clauses or other restrictions. The
computer leases contain a provision whereby the title of the property will transfer at the end of the lease if
the lease is not terminated, however the value of the computers is below the district’s capitalization
threshold. The copiers are an operating lease and title will not be transferred to the district. The current
leases are primarily obligations of the general fund; however several other funds pay for copiers that they
are using.
For the year ended June 30, 2015, the district reported a deficit net position of $1,192,570,064 in the
government-wide statements. This deficit can be attributed to the implementation of GASB 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27, requiring
the recognition of a long-term liability for pensions. Also, liabilities related to the district’s execution of
Certificates of Participation and General Obligation bonds to fund retirement and necessary capital and
maintenance projects of the district’s facilities.
For the year ended June 30, 2015, the district incurred expenses in excess of appropriations in the
ProComp special revenue fund, Building fund and Tuition special revenue fund by $707,976,
$12,982,483 and $4,870,599, respectively, which may be a violation of state statute. The district also
reported a deficit net position in the Warehouse internal service fund of $22,027, which may be a
violation of state statute. The district believes standard operations will help reduce the deficit in the
Warehouse internal service fund.

The component unit combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity of $303,519. The
changes in reporting entity include the addition of new charter schools (footnoted as A in the combining
statements).
Blended Component Unit
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c) (3) and
501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code, and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings and equipment
for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for the creation and
continued management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is ultimately responsible for
any deficits or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation issued by the DSFLC and its
activities for the year are reflected in the accompanying government-wide financial statements of the
district. An evaluation of the DSFLC using the above considerations results in its blended inclusion in
the accompanying financial statements. There are no separate financial statements available for the
DSFLC and the financial information of the DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government
which is why DSFLC is not shown on the schedules in this note.
Discretely Presented Component Units
Denver Public Schools Foundation
In 1984 the Denver Public Schools Foundation (the “Foundation”) was incorporated as a widely based not
for profit charitable organization whose educational purposes are to support the mission, goals and
objectives of the district. Separately issued financial statements are available from the foundation at 1860
Lincoln Street, 9th Floor, Denver, CO 80203.
Charter Schools
In 1993, the State of Colorado Legislature enacted the “Charter School Act – Colorado Revised Statutes
(CRS) Section 22-30.5-101,” which permits the District to contract with individuals and organizations for
the operation of charter schools within the District. The charter schools are financed by a portion of the
District’s School Finance Act Revenues (based on student enrollment), mill levy override property tax
dollars, and state and federal grants, as well as other revenues generated by the charter school. The
District’s Board of Education must approve all charter school applications for new schools; however, they
have their own separate governing boards.
