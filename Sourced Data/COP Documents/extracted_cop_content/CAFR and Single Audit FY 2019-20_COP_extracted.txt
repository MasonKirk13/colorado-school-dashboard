MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
Management of School District No. 1 in the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado (the
District), provides readers of the District’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) this narrative
overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We
encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information
that is presented in the letter of transmittal, which starts on page 10 of this report.
Financial Highlights
On the statement of net position, as of June 30, 2020, the District’s net position for governmental
activities is a deficit of $1,129.5 million. The deficit net position is primarily the result of two factors. The
first is the result of the District executing certificates of participation (COPs) to fund the District’s pension
plan known as Denver Public Schools Retirement System (DPSRS) prior to its merger as a separate
division within the state’s Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA). In July of 1997, the District
executed $384.2 million in COPs with the net proceeds contributed to DPSRS. In April of 2008, the District
issued $750 million in COPs to refund existing certificates and to fund an additional $397.8 million
contribution to DPSRS in anticipation of the merger with PERA. As a result of these contributions, the
District’s PERA division is 84.73% funded compared to the PERA School division of 64.52% as of
December 31, 2019. Second, in order to fund the District's capital program, the voters of Denver
authorized general obligation bonds. The proceeds of these bonds are used to fund capital and
maintenance of the District's facilities. (See additional details in Note 5 and Note 6 to the financial
statements).
Long-term liabilities decreased to $3,354.9 million from $3,644.0 million in FY 2020 primarily due to a
reduction in the net pension liability based on actuarial assumptions related to GASB 68.
On the statement of activities, general revenues accounted for $1,285.8 million or 82% of total revenues
and program revenues were $274.8 million or 18% of the total revenues of the primary government. The
total revenues increased to $1,560.6 million from $1,531.5 million, or 5.9% when compared to prior year,
primarily due to increased property taxes. Net position increased $147 million partially due to a net
pension credit of $74 million, and a net OPEB credit of $6 million.
Overview of the Financial Statements
Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components: 1) government-wide
financial statements, 2) fund financial statements and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report
also contains required supplementary information and other supplementary information.
Government-wide Statements
The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with information about the
District as a whole using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector businesses.
The statement of net position includes all of the District’s assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities
and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference reported as net position to the exclusion of
fiduciary funds. The statement of activities presents information on how the District’s net position
changed during the fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported when the underlying event
giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, revenues and
expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal
periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and retiree sick leave payable).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
The government-wide financial statements consolidate the governmental and internal service activities
that are supported from taxes and intergovernmental revenues. In the government-wide financial
statements the District’s activities are shown as:
Governmental activities: Most of the District’s basic services are included here, such as instruction,
transportation, operations and maintenance and administration. Taxes and intergovernmental revenues
principally support these activities.
The government-wide financial statements encompass not only the District itself (the primary
government) but also legally-separate entities including the ProComp Special Revenue Fund, Denver
School Facilities Leasing Corporation, Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust and Private
Purpose Trust as blended component units and Denver Public Schools Foundation and charter schools as
discretely presented component units.
Fund Financial Statements
A fund is a grouping of related accounts used to maintain control over resources that have been
segregated for specific activities or objectives. The fund financial statements provide more detailed
information about the District’s operations, focusing on its most significant or major funds, not the District
as a whole. The District has three types of funds: governmental funds, proprietary funds and fiduciary
funds.
Governmental funds: Most of the District’s services are included in governmental funds, which
generally focus on how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flows and
the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds
statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine the status of financial resources that
can be spent in the near future to finance the District’s programs.
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. Thus,
readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.
Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to the government-wide financial
statements in order to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental
activities. The District maintains nine individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately
in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues,
expenditures and changes in fund balances for the General, Grants Special Revenue, Bond Redemption
(debt service), Building and Capital Reserve, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data for the
other four governmental funds (Pupil Activity Special Revenue, Food Services Special Revenue, ProComp
Special Revenue and Permanent) are combined into a single, aggregated presentation. Individual fund
data for each of these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements
included in this report.
Prior to the adoption of GASB 84, Fiduciary Activities, in 2020, the school-sponsored student activities
managed at the school level were reported as an Agency Fund.
Proprietary funds: The District uses an internal service fund to account for its warehouse activity.
Internal service funds allocate costs internally among the District’s various functions while deriving

A significant portion of the District’s assets are its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings,
equipment and capital leases). The District uses these assets to provide instruction and related services to
its students. Capital assets (net) increased to $1,554.3 million in FY 2020 from $1,439.5 million in FY
2019. The increase is primarily a result of capital spending from the District’s general obligation bonds
and certificates of participation. The District’s capital assets will continue to increase as planned projects
are completed in the Capital Reserve and Building Funds. Combined, these funds have available fund
balance of $256.4 million.
Current and other assets decreased to $900.4 million from $946.6 million primarily due to the 2020 COP
issuance for Kepner and Energy Performance Contract spend.
The following table provides a summary of the District’s net position as of June 30, 2020 and 2019,
respectively (in millions):

Unrestricted (1,322.5) (1,834.6)
Total net position (deficit) $ (1,129.5) $ (1,281.3)
To calculate net investment in capital assets, the original long-term debt was evaluated to ascertain the
amount of proceeds spent on capital improvement versus non-capital expenditures. The percentage was
then applied to the outstanding long-term debt to determine the amount applicable to capital assets.

Most revenues to Colorado's school districts are provided through the Public School Finance Act of 1994
(as amended). The District’s adjusted total program funding for FY 2020 was $796.9 million reflected as a
combination of state equalization and a portion of property tax revenues in the Statement of Activity. This
was based on a funded pupil count of 91,185 and per pupil total program funding of $8,739, compared to
total program funding of $737.3 million funded pupil count of 87,644 and per pupil total program funding
of $8,412 in FY 2019. Of the adjusted total program funding, $239.0 million was funded through state
share compared to $279.5 million in FY 2019. The remainder was funded through a combination of local
property and specific ownership taxes.
The District generated $956.9 million in property tax revenues in FY 2020 comparedto $814.6 million in FY
2019. Total property tax revenues include School Finance Act mills, override election mills, Tax
Abatement mills and Bond Redemption Fund mills. Tax revenues increased by $140.3 million and are
attributable to the rising property valuations in the City and County of Denver, partially offset by a
decrease in state equalization of $40.5 million. The collection amount in 2020 increased to $3.9 billion,
based on the County Assessor. Total expenses for the primary government in FY 2020 were $1,413.1
million compared to $1,320.9 million in FY 2019. Total expenses increased by $92.1 million partially due
to an increase in PERA employer contributions as well as salary increases for hourly employees and
teachers following the 2019 renegotiated teacher contract.

restricted emergency reserve of $33.6 million as required by the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) and
state statute.
Assigned fund balance includes $13.8 million budgeted for subsequent year expenditure and $23.5 million
for special projects.
The Grant Special Revenue Fund balance as of June 30, 2020 was $14.8 million compared to $17.0 million
at June 30, 2019. The fund balance is restricted to the District’s grant funded programs that generated
the fund balance.
The Bond Redemption Fund balance as of June 30, 2020 was $201.8 million compared to $167.6 million
as of June 30, 2019. The Bond Redemption Fund is restricted for payment of the District’s General
Obligation Bond debt service as authorized by Denver voters.
The Building Fund as of June 30, 2020 was $183.0 million compared to $296.8 million as of June 30,
2019. The Building Fund consists of unspent proceeds from issuance of voter approved general obligation
bonds and is restricted for financing projects as described in the respective ballot language.
The Capital Reserve Fund as of June 30, 2020 was $73.4 million compared to $118.6 million as of June
30, 2019. The Capital Reserve Fund consists of unspent COPs restricted for financing capital projects and
for debt service. Additionally, a portion of Capital Reserve Fund is restricted for capital projects by Board
authorization and assigned to debt service by Board adoption of the annual budget.
The Building Fund decreased by $113.8 million as a result of the 2016 general obligation bond capital
expenditures. Capital Reserve Fund decreased by $45.2 million as a result of the certificates of
participation capital expenditures. The Bond Redemption Fund increased $34.2 million due to the increase
in property tax. The Grant Special Reserve Fund decreased $2.2 million, due to spending of funds for
their intended purpose.
Proprietary funds
The District’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide
financial statements, but in more detail. The fund statements show the Internal Service Fund, the
District’s only proprietary fund, which is included with the governmental activities for the
government-wide financial statements.
General Fund Budgetary Highlights
In accordance with state law, the District’s budget is prepared on a GAAP basis. The most significant
budgeted fund is the General Fund.
The difference between the General Fund original and final budget for expenditures increased by $38.3
million to account for additional revenue received due to enrollment changes from original projections,
specifically due to a higher enrollment in grades 1-12.
As a result of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the District faces economic uncertainties which
impacts the budget. As classroom instruction shifted to 100% remote learning, the District realized
savings in operational departments due to the closure of buildings, specifically in Transportation and
Utilities. In addition, the District received federal funding of $65 million as part of the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to help cover costs related to the District's response to
COVID-19. The District had increased unplanned expenses for technology that were paid by the CARES

funding. In addition, as revenues for student meals went down, CARES funding helped cover these
expenses to provide free breakfast and lunch to students and their families.
The Colorado State Board of Education voted to support legislation to provide state funding for full-day
kindergarten throughout Colorado.
Capital Assets and Debt Administration
Capital assets
The District’s investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation for its governmental activities
as of June 30, 2020 amounted to $1,554.3 million. Investment in capital assets includes land, buildings
and improvements, equipment, capital leases and construction in progress with an original cost greater
than $5,000 and an estimated useful life longer than one year.
The major capital events during the current fiscal year included spending on capital projects in the
Building and Capital Reserve Funds. Such capital projects are used to make necessary improvements and
critical repairs.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial
statements. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred,
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the fiscal year
for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility
requirements imposed by the provider have been met.
The effect of interfund activity has generally been eliminated from the government-wide financial
statements. Exceptions to this are charges between the District’s governmental activities and component
units. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the
various functions concerned.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the
District considers grant revenues to be available if they are collected within 180 days of the fiscal
year-end. Property tax and other revenues are considered available if collected within 60 days of the
year-end. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting.
However, debt service expenditures as well as expenditures related to compensated absences are
recorded only when payment is due.
The District’s fiduciary funds apply the accrual basis of accounting and the economic resources
measurement focus.
The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate
accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing
accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenue and expenditures or expenses as
appropriate. Government resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the
purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.
For governmental activities, when both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the
District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources, as they are needed.
Governmental Funds
The District reports the following major governmental funds:
The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial
resources except those required to be accounted for in other funds as detailed below. Primary revenue
sources for the general fund include property taxes, state equalization, and tuition billing for early
childhood education.
The Grants Special Revenue Fund is used for the revenues and expenditures related to federal, state, and
local grants. Special Revenue funds are used to account for proceeds of special revenue sources that are
legally or otherwise restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. Revenue restrictions in this fund are
imposed by the grantor for the specific purposes of the grant.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
The Bond Redemption Fund (debt service fund) accounts for and reports financial resources that are
restricted for the payment of principal and interest on long-term general obligation debt of the District as
a result of the issuance of general obligation bonds.
The Building Fund is a capital projects fund and accounts for construction and renovation projects funded
by the sale of general obligation bonds.
The Capital Reserve Fund is a capital projects fund and accounts for ongoing capital outlay needs of the
District such as repairs and maintenance including proceeds from the issuance of COP's.
The District reports the following nonmajor governmental funds:
The Food Services Special Revenue Fund accounts for the revenue and expenses related to providing
students with healthy and nutritious meals. Revenue sources for this fund include federal and state grants
and private sources.
The Pupil Activity Special Revenue Fund accounts for the revenue and expenditures of sponsoring athletic
events at District middle and high schools. The fund also represents school sponsored student activities
managed at the school level.
The ProComp Special Revenue Fund is a blended component unit used to account for the proceeds of
voter approved taxes from the 2005 mill levy override. The investments and expenditures are the
professional compensation system of the teachers.
The Permanent Fund is used to account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent that
only earnings and not principal may be used for purposes that support the District’s programs.
Internal Service and Fiduciary Funds
The Internal Service Fund is used to account for goods and services provided to departments and schools
primarily within the District on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Proprietary (internal service) funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non operating.
Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services or producing and delivering
goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the District’s internal service fund are charges to customers for sales and services. Operating
expenses for the internal service fund include the cost of sales and services and administrative expenses.
The District has two Fiduciary funds which include the Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund and the Private
Purpose Trust Fund. The Private Purpose Trust Fund is used to report all fiduciary activities that are not
required to be reported in pension and other employee benefit trust funds or investment trust funds and
are held in trust. The Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund is used to report the MetLife Retiree Life
Insurance OPEB Plan since the assets are administered through a trust in which Denver Public Schools is
not a beneficiary, dedicated to providing benefits to retirees or designated beneficiaries in accordance
with the benefit terms, and legally protected from the creditors of Denver Public Schools. The District
included the Retiree Life Insurance trust as a fiduciary component unit in its financial statements. The
District’s postemployment health benefits were transferred to PERACare on January 1, 2010.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
Accrued Payroll
The accrued payroll represents payment in arrears earned as of June 30 as well as the liability to teachers
and certain other employees who earn their salaries over the school year but are paid over a
twelve-month period from August 1 to July 31. Changes in the accrual are reflected in expenditures or
expenses on the applicable fund's statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances.
Certain payroll benefits and part-time salaries which are payable at June 30 are also included.
Encumbrances
Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the
expenditures of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation, is
employed as an extension of formal budgetary integration in all funds.
Compensated Absences
The compensated absence liability including payroll taxes, reported on the government-wide financial
statements consists of accumulated sick and vacation leave which vests and is payable upon termination
or retirement. Accumulated sick leave vests only at qualified retirement and vests as a rate determined by
contract, which is less than the normal rate of pay. A qualified retiree can be paid for up to one
work-years' worth of accumulated sick leave. Retirees who accumulate vacation leave are compensated
at their normal rate of pay for the balance at retirement. On the fund financial statements, compensated
absence amounts are reported as expenditures or expenses, as appropriate, when paid.
Long-term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements and proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements,
long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities or proprietary fund type statement of net position. Debt premiums and discounts are deferred
and amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
interest method. The appropriate obligations are reported net of the applicable debt premium or discount.
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize debt premiums and discounts during
the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums
received on debt issuance is reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuance is
reported as other financing uses. In accordance with Section 22-45-103, CRS, the District’s bond
redemption fund custodian for FY 2020 was U.S. Bank.
Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
In accordance with GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities, GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement
No. 27 and GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits
other than Pensions, the government-wide statements include deferred outflows of resources
representing the deferred loss on refunding of the District’s certificates of participation and bond
obligations and items relating to the District’s pension and OPEB obligations. Deferred inflows of
resources relate to deferred gain on refunding, pension, and OPEB obligations. Additionally, the
governmental fund financial statements include deferred inflows of resources for property taxes
receivable and long-term receivables that have not met modified accrual revenue recognition criteria.

Net Position
In the government-wide statements, net position consists of net investment in capital assets, restricted
and unrestricted net positions. Restricted net position includes amounts for debt service,
performance-based teacher compensation, emergency reserve, higher education, non-governmental
grantor-designated purposes, federal programs, permanent fund and capital projects.
Fund Balances
Fund balances for governmental funds are reported in classifications that comprise a hierarchy based
primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for
which amounts in those funds can be spent. For the classification of fund balances, the District considers
amounts to have been spent when expenditure is incurred for purposes for which fund balance is both
available and can be used. In accordance with GASB Statement 54, the fund balances of the District are
classified into the following categories: nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned or unassigned.
Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in
spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact, including items that are
not expected to be converted to cash.
Restricted fund balance includes amounts where constraints have been placed on the use of resources by
either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or
laws or regulations of other governments; or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or
enabling legislation.
Committed fund balance includes amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to
constraints imposed by the Board of Education. Committed amounts cannot be used for any other
purpose unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of
formal action (for example, resolution) it employed to previously commit those amounts. Committed fund
balance also incorporates contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have
been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements.
Assigned fund balance includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be used for
specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. The Board of Education adopted a fund
balance policy and as part of the policy delegated the authority to the Superintendent or designee to
assign amounts to be used for specific purposes.
Unassigned fund balance represents residual fund balance that has not been restricted, committed or
assigned. Positive unassigned fund balance can only be reported in the general fund while negative
unassigned fund balance may be reported in any governmental fund.
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is
available, the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first. When an expenditure is incurred
for which committed, assigned, or unassigned fund balances are available, the District considers amounts
to have been spent first out of committed funds, then assigned funds and finally unassigned funds, as
needed, unless the Board of Education has provided otherwise in its commitment or assignment actions.

Investments Authorized by the Colorado Statutes and District’s Investment Policy
The table below identifies the investment types that are authorized by the District’s investment policy or
Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS), where more restrictive. The table also identifies certain provisions of the
District’s investment policy that address interest rate risk, credit risk and concentration of credit risk. The
table does not address the investments of (a) debt proceeds that are governed by the provisions of the debt
agreements of the District, or (b) Special Revenue ProComp Trust assets that are governed by the Trust’s
Investment Policy Statement rather than the general provisions of the District’s investment policy.

*Other than repurchase agreements for investment of general obligation bond proceeds and certificates of
deposit.
As of June 30, 2020 the District investments are in compliance with the investment policy.
Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements
The District invests in various investment securities that are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is possible that changes in the
values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such change could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.
The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally
accepted accounting principles. The valuation is based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the
asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are inputs other
than those within Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 inputs are significant
unobservable inputs.
63

--- PAGE 64 ---

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
The District has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2020:
 Corporate Notes of $7,233,892 are valued using quoted market price or other observable inputs
(Level 1 and 2 inputs).
 U.S. Treasury securities of $44,343,046 are valued using quoted price in active markets for
identical assets (Level 1 inputs).
 Federal Agency Bonds/Notes of $2,048,091 are valued using quoted market price or other
observable inputs (Level 1 inputs).
 Repurchase Agreements of $27,824,996 are valued using pricing models (Level 2 inputs).
Custodial Credit Risk
Colorado law requires the District to use eligible public depositories as defined by the Public Deposit
Protection Act of 1989 (the Act). Under the Act, the depository is required to pledge eligible collateral having
a market value at all times equal to 102% of the aggregate public depositories not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Eligible collateral as defined by the Act primarily includes obligations of, or
guarantees by, the U.S. government, the State of Colorado or any political subdivision thereof and
obligations evidenced by notes secured by first lien mortgages of trust on real property.
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District will not be able to recover its
deposits nor the collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.
The District’s deposits are with eligible public depositories and are considered to be held in the name of the
District. These deposits have bank balances of $14,689,406 and related carrying amount of $6,534,057.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest rates. The
District’s investment policy addresses interest rate risk by requiring adherence to the Colorado Revised
Statutes. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing a combination of shorter and
longer-term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is either
maturing or close to maturing as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed by operations and
debt service requirements.

Net investment in capital assets is estimated by first comparing the total building fund expenditures since
2011 to the capital outlay from the building fund for the same time frame which is 88.19% as of June 30,
2020. The calculation of net investment in capital assets is below and results in a negative net investment
in capital assets as certain capital assets are depreciated over a shorter life than the related debt service.

In prior years, the registered voters of Denver authorized the School District to issue general obligation
bonds. As of June 30, 2020, all previously authorized bonds had been issued.
On May 1, 2013, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $58.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013C. The certificates provided funding of various projects in the Stapleton Urban
Redevelopment Area including the acquisition, improvement, and placement in service of one additional
District elementary and K-8 schools. Also included were various improvements to the high school and
sports field. The District and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority have entered into a 2013 Supplemental

projects which will serve as the source of repayment for the Series 2013C Certificates of Participation.
In September of 2015, as authorized by Board resolution, the District executed $8.6 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2015B. The proceeds were used for the purchase of the parking garage located at
1855 Lincoln Street in downtown Denver and the land upon which it is located. The primary purpose is to
provide affordable and long-term parking for the users of the Emily Griffith Campus. The Certificates
explain undivided interests in the right to receive certain revenues payable by the District under an
annually renewed Lease Purchase Agreement dated on October 5, 2015.
In May of 2017, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $32 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2017A and $14 million of Certificates of Participation, Series 2017B. The purpose of
the 2017A issuance was to construct the Stapleton Park Street School, an elementary school located in
the Stapleton neighborhood of Denver. The proceeds from 2017B issuance were used to purchase a
school site for the Stapleton Park Street School and to help fund the design and construction cost of a fire
station near the school site to meet safety standards for DPS schools within Stapleton.
In November of 2017, as authorized by the Board resolution, the District issued $10 million Refunding
Certificate of Participation, Series 2017C. The proceeds for the issuance in combination with the proceeds
received from the sale of Emily Griffith Opportunity School properties were used for the refunding of
$35.2 million of 2013A Certificate of Participation.
In February of 2018, as authorized by Board resolution, the District issued $7.7 million Certificates of
Participation, Series 2018. The proceeds were used to purchase a building located at 1617 South Acoma
Street in Denver and the site upon which it is located. The Acoma building currently houses 150 District
employees in the Planning, Design and Construction, Library Services, JROTC, Extended Learning and
Community Schools departments.

Actuarial assumptionsThe total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2020 actuarial valuation was determined
using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless
otherwise specified:
Actuarial cost method Entry Age Normal
Not applicable since only standard tables are
used due to credibility constraints for actual
Last experience study experience.
Long-term investment rate of return, net of OPEB
plan investment expenses, including price inflation 2.90 percent
Discount rate 2.90 percent
Mortality table - 2010 Pub General Healthy Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate Scale and 2010 Pub
General Disabled Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate
The plan does not have enough credible data to develop a mortality assumption. As a result, the plan
must rely on publicly available mortality tables. The Society of Actuaries recently published and
recommends using both 2010 Pub General Healthy Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate scale and 2010 Pub
General Disabled Retiree with 100% of MP Ultimate scale.
Discount rate The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 2.90%. The discount rate
is based on management assumptions and estimates of asset composition, and long-term expected
interest rate returns. In estimating the discount rate the District is convinced the OPEB plan’s fiduciary net
position is projected to be sufficient to make projected benefit payments and OPEB plan assets are
expected to be invested using a strategy to achieve that return. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB
plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected OPEB payments for
current retirees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied
to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability.
Plan assets The LIFA Fund is invested in the MetLife General Account and expected return on assets is
based on a combination of the Bloomberg Barclays Capital Government/Credit Bond and the Bloomberg
Barclays Capital Government/Credit Long Indices.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The District is a party to pending or potential lawsuits under which it may be required to pay certain
amounts upon final disposition of these matters. After consulting with counsel, the District’s management
has concluded that no significant adverse effect on the June 30, 2020 financial statements should result
upon final disposition of these proceedings.
The District has a potential liability relating to the "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act" (the Act),
which is a federally-funded hazardous material/asbestos management program administered by the State
Health Department. It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with the Act, therefore no liability
has been accrued. It is expected that these expenditures will not have a significant impact on the
financial position of the District.
Under terms of federal and state grants, periodic audits are required and certain costs may be questioned
as not being appropriate expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to
reimbursement to the grantor agencies. The District's management believes a disallowance, if any, will be
immaterial.
For the year ended June 30, 2020, the District reported a deficit net position of $1,129,522,542 in the
government-wide statements. This deficit can be partially attributed to the implementation of GASB 68,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27 and
GASB 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions
requiring the recognition of a long-term liability for pensions and postemployment benefits other than
pensions respectively. Liabilities related to the District’s Certificates of Participation and General
Obligation bonds are to fund retirement and necessary capital and maintenance projects of the District’s
facilities.
Encumbrances represent a contractual obligation and expenditures are recognized when the goods and
services are delivered and/or received. As of June 30, 2020 encumbrances for the governmental funds
were:
Fund Encumbrances
General 79,157,425
Building 45,341,426
Capital Reserve 31,300,328
Grant Special Revenue Fund 14,376,723
Nonmajor Funds 401,283
Total $ 170,577,185
General Fund encumbrances include significant commitments to the District’s health care plans and utility
costs as well as districtwide and school level operations.
Building Fund encumbrances include commitments towards major capital maintenance and construction
projects such as but not limited to the HVAC mechanical upgrades at Hamilton, Beach Court, and Garden
Place. In addition, there were commitments for Learning Landscape improvements across several
locations.

13. CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS
At the general election held November 1992, voters approved the TABOR amendment to the Colorado
Constitution limiting the ability of the state and local governments such as the District to increase
revenues, debt and spending and restricting property, income and other taxes. In November 1999 the
Denver voters gave the District approval to exceed the spending limits established in TABOR beginning
with the 1999 fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the state and local governments obtain voter
approval to create any "multiple fiscal year direct or indirect debt or other financial obligation whatsoever
without adequate present cash reserves pledged irrevocably and held for payments in all future fiscal
years.” The amendment exempts from its restrictions the borrowings and fiscal operations of enterprises.
Enterprises are defined to include government owned businesses authorized to issue their own revenue
bonds and receiving under 10% of their grants from all state and local government sources combined.
The amendment also requires the establishment of an emergency reserve equal to three percent of fiscal
year spending excluding debt service.
In accordance with TABOR, the District maintains an emergency reserve of 3% of fiscal year spending by
designating real property owned by the District in lieu of cash. For fiscal year 2020, spending was
$1,261,408,507 and the 3% emergency reserve was $37,842,255, which excludes multi-year obligations
of $264,116. Additionally, in accordance with C.R.S. Section 22-44-105, the District established an
emergency cash reserve as a restricted fund balance in the General Fund for $33,618,750 equal to 3% of
budgeted General Fund revenues.

SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER AND STATE OF COLORADO
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020
14. COMPONENT UNITS
The District has 30 component units consisting of 4 blended component units and 26 discretely presented
component units. Charter schools are included in the component units as they are fiscally dependent
upon revenues derived from the State per pupil revenue funding calculation.
Change in Reporting Entity
The component unit combining financial statements reflect changes in reporting entity. The changes in
reporting entity include charter schools with expired charters that were not renewed.
Blended Component Units
Denver School Facilities Leasing Corporation
The DSFLC was formed in December 1985 as a not-for-profit corporation under Sections 501(c) (3) and
501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code and exists solely to acquire real estate, buildings and equipment
for schools for future lease to the District. The District is primarily responsible for the creation and
continued management of the DSFLC, has influence over its operations and is ultimately responsible for
any deficits or operating deficiencies. The certificates of participation issued by the DSFLC and its
activities for the year are reflected in the accompanying government-wide financial statements of the
District. An evaluation of the DSFLC using the above considerations results in its blended inclusion in the
accompanying financial statements. There are no separate financial statements available for the DSFLC
and the financial information of the DSFLC is blended with that of the primary government which is why
DSFLC is not shown on the schedules in this note.
Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System for Teachers
The Denver Public Schools Professional Compensation System (ProComp) was established following the
approval of the 2005 Mill Levy Override as a groundbreaking compensation system that links teacher pay
to the instructional mission of the District. Designed in a partnership between the Denver Classroom
Teachers Association (DCTA) and the District, ProComp has received national attention because it
rewards teachers for their professional accomplishments while linking pay to student achievement. The
financial information of ProComp is blended with that of the primary government, which is why ProComp
is not shown on the schedules in this note. ProComp is presented as a component unit because it is a
separate legal entity and is financially accountable to the District.
Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust
The Denver Public Schools Retiree Life Insurance Trust provides benefits to participants eligible to retire
prior to September 1, 1997. The eligible participants receive a $10,000 retiree life insurance benefit. Life
insurance benefits are not available to anyone who retires after January 1, 2006. Benefits are self-insured
with a retiree plan trust administered by MetLife. DPSRLIT is considered a fiduciary component unit under
the provisions of GASB 14. The Financial Reporting Entity as amended and GASB 84, Fiduciary Activities.
